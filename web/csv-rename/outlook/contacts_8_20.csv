Hi Amanda,_x000D_
_x000D_
Lynn said that you are our special contact at Aakron. I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I had a customer order some 12 oz. mood stadium cups, already paid, approved, etc. The order is already in house and everything. I got a call from production that you cannot do less than min of these. Well, I didn't see in catalog that it's on the first drinkware page, not each seperate item, that there's no less than min.  Is there any way you could make an exception on this since I told the customer it was available? It's PO Q140152JS. Please let me know._x000D_

Hi Chanda,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Just wanted to follow up for the remaining pcs that are in production and verify ship dates/due dates._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
From the original spreadsheet - the ""due date"" column had read ""this can ship ground"" and email saying that the remaining pcs to deliver the week of 27th ground....but from the revised drop ship spreadsheet sent with proof approval - there are due dates of 9/28 - is this date firm?_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
We do ask for at least 10 days production on FCD items....we have other orders in-house that we've been working with and switching around to get out by specific dates_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I am continuously getting updates from production on how things are moving along - we have two machines running all in-house jobs - and believes that we can possibly start shipping out Friday on this order; we can ship daily as they become available - are there any locations that need them more than others? Are dates firm? Please advise._x000D_

Hi Ladies,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Just wanted to let you know that we did run into some film issues - they have apx 200pcs done today - and unfortunately won't ship out today - we are running tomorrow and Monday to push out the 800pcs - as I said in Andrea's VM, it is a 2-day ship to Indiana from our NY plant (standard) and the TX shipment would have to be a 2-day expedited service to arrive for event date 9/22 at those locations._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
We do have a 20,000pc order in-house that we did pull off to start running your order - I apologize for the delay, but have advised that poor film may arise._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Please give me a call at your earliest convenience if you have any questions._x000D_

                    I wanted to let you know that this evening, I posted the attached flyer on Oscar.   The question I had is, we wanted to offer an EmbroidMe exclusive pricing on a couple of these ice scrapers.  What is the best way to communicate this special offer to the store owners.  The flyer that I attached only has pricing as low as and the EQP Price._x000D_

                    In the past, in my former life, when ran specials I sent them to you and your worked your magic.   With everything funneling to Oscar, I was not sure what is the best way to get it communicated to the field?_x000D_

No particular color - we love this pen and I just wanted a couple of samples for personal use...is that ok?

Also - I have not received my contract pricing for 2012.  I asked Vicki Bobo if she had seen anything and has not.  Can you update me?

Of course. Do you need samples of a particular color and how many?

There is no markings or info on the refill so I am not certain what ""type"" or size of refill but I'm sure you could take the refill to any office store and locate refills.

They are easy enough to remove and replace….

Good afternoon Pam ,_x000D_
_x000D_
We definitely can offer a  custom  scale based off your clients artwork . We normally charge $ 30.00 on a G for every 3” for the die/Logo . There is no charge for straight line type ._x000D_
The custom scale would be approximately $ 288.00  in addition  to your per piece price._x000D_
However , If it is possible for you to send me the artwork I can see if it would be possible to break the scale up differently so we are able to lessen this die/logo charge ._x000D_
I look forward to hearing back from you !_x000D_

If a customer can provide vector artwork, can custom printed measurement scales be printed on your Yardsticks, Item #90999, instead of the standard measurement scale? This would be a 1-color imprint for 250 pieces._x000D_

My UPS account is 845103.  Please ship them to the address under my name below. 1 or 2 of each color of your Executive Grip pen #15331 should be plenty. Preferably with something generic inscribed on them…my customer is concerned about how big the printing area is and a visual would help them. If you don’t have anything inscribed, that’s okay, too.

Thank you!

Hi Brooke,

 

No charge for samples, would just need a shipper # (UPS or FEDEX) and no PO necessary...just let me know what you'd like and I can get them on their way.

 

Thanks,
Carrie

Hi, Carrie,

                I need to get samples of your Executive Grip pen #15331 to show to my customer. Where would I send a PO for that and how much do you charge for samples?

Hi Robert, 

 

Please see quote attached - I have also suggested other cup sizes to get closer to your goal...We can also get a quote from a printer that we outsource through - their MOQ is 100,000pcs - and they do a little bit different printing (off-set); it isn't as true/vibrant and opaque printing however...let me know if you are interested in that.

Thanks.

 

Thank you for contacting us for a price quotation. Please reference your quote number when sending in a purchase order. Attached is the information you requested. The pricing quoted is net, FOB factory. If you should need additional information or assistance, please do not hesitate to call us. We look forward to working with you. Please visit our website, www.aakronline.com <blocked::http://www.aakronline.com/> , for real-time order tracking, specials, product information, show schedules and case histories.

I believe if you look at the pricing I have offered , you will see that we are offering quite a discount on these items . These are all items that we noticed are great sellers for Aakron , but do not seem to have much traction with Discount Mugs and would like to help boost them with you as well ._x000D_
I have attached the link to our snack line . If any of these items interest you please let me know and I would be happy to send pricing to you . I have heard that we will be discontinuing this line in 2017 ._x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
_x000D_
Most of these items are already on the DiscountMugs web site, can you please review the suggested items. Also, do you have any holiday food gifts that we currently do not carry?_x000D_
_x000D_
I will forward the full color printing question to the rest of the team and will confirm._x000D_

Hello JP ,_x000D_
_x000D_
It was nice chatting with you yesterday !_x000D_
 I have attached a price sheet of what we would like to offer through the end of the year to see how this works for you ._x000D_
Please let me know if you are interested and I will make sure that we update this pricing in our system ._x000D_
I also wanted to let you know that we are offering Full color printing direct on our 20 ounce mood bottles and wanted to be sure you were aware of this as Discount Mugs does tend to send in a lot of these types of orders . Pricing for a Full color imprint is only about $ .15 more than a one color imprint so it is a great new option we have .  I have attached a little more information below on this new process below ._x000D_
The link to our Holiday Catalog is below . I started putting these items in a spreadsheet for you yesterday , but this is taking a little longer to accomplish than I had planned,  as we have been short staffed I am getting pulled off it ._x000D_
I look forward to hearing back from you JP !_x000D_
Have a great afternoon ._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you,_x000D_

     Currently, we offer the following ice scrapers on our 24 hour rush program which we refer to as our You First Program.   I attached the details of this program:_x000D_

     I did check with our production department, we are able to offer the additional following ice scrapers under our You First program:_x000D_
_x000D_

     40052 – Small Ice Scraper<http://www.aakronline.com/small-ice-scraper-315.html>_x000D_

     40056 â€“ Large Mood Ice Scraper<http://www.aakronline.com/large-mood-ice-scraper-597.html>_x000D_
_x000D_
     40057- Large Translucent Ice Scraper<http://www.aakronline.com/large-translucent-ice-scraper-599.html>_x000D_

_x000D_
     On the new additional ice scrapers, in order to get them on our You First program, we are going to change the printing method from hot stamping to silk-screening.    The imprint colors are different from hot stamp to pad print and we are not able to do the metallic imprint colors for sure on pad print.   Any 24 hour order will be pad printed and any normal production order will be hot stamped.  â€‹â€‹  You will not have to specify the imprint method on your orders_x000D_
_x000D_
     Is this acceptable?   Please let me know if adding the ice scrapers to your site is approved and I will let our team know how to proceed._x000D_
_x000D_
     If you have any questions, please let me know._x000D_

We have a large selection of the existing AAkron product line on your website.    If there are any changes to existing items:  item colors, pricing, etc. what is be best way to get this information to you?  Is there a spreadsheet we need to complete or would you like our product data file sent over to you or to someone else on the team?       We could start working on this now to make the conversion easier._x000D_

We can do assorted pencil colors - but we cannot do multi-color imprint on the 20245 - the new art you attached looked like it had two colors....so are we approved for both art works?

Hello Ashley~_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
2017 will be a special year for the AAkron family; AAkron Line is turning 50 years old.  We have come a long way from the two-car garage that was our first production and office space.   We would not have grown to the company we are today without the support of our customers like you._x000D_
_x000D_
AAkron Line is pleased to announce that the JKG Group  has been extended our 2017 EQP Pricing Program for 2017 .    This program recognizes and rewards our top clients for their continued partnership and support._x000D_
Attached are the program details & requirements for your records. The annual sales volume requirements for this program are $10,000. Please note that certain items are excluded such as our Solo Pencils and closeout items .  You will also find a Net Price list for items that are on EQP , this list also states if the item is available on any rush programs and where it is made  . To help ensure that we exceed this requirement for 2017, we can help with marketing support, program suggestions and much more.  Just let us know how we can help._x000D_
_x000D_
New for 2017, we added over 50 new products and we expanded the AAkron exclusive items to over 125 items.  AAkron is also trailblazing new printing techniques with the introduction of our Full Color Direct printing.  FCD Direct printing offers full color decorating on a growing list of drinkware items on either 1/side, 2/side or a full wrap full color printing for about the same price as 1/c imprinting and for the same set up charge.  Let us show you how you can capitalize on this growing trend so you can part of the FCD printing sales train._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you for the support over the years and ,We look forward to making 2017 a success for all,  and further developing our partnership._x000D_
_x000D_
Very truly yours,_x000D_

I am working to get this sent through. The attachments were unrecognizable.

Would this be a repeat order? If so, do you have the old job number or purchase order number?

 

I will work on this in the mean time.

Carrie,

This customer is also going to purchase 15331 at the same time as these bags in a qty of 2000 pcs.

Can I get a price for both at the same time? Trying to keep my customer's costs down even if we don't get it in by 12/31/09.

Delivery on both items will be end of January 2010.

Thanks foy your help

We have a customer who has found pricing locally on item # 70010 (Mood Straw) that is better than EQP with the set-up fee waived; one color/one location. They plan to order 600 pieces at a time, multiple times a year._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_

Can you help us compete? They are looking for a price that will last the year and not a one-time special._x000D_

Normally I would say yes on this , but We are having problems with the molding of these cups so I am not certain we will be able to have these in our TN plant before this. I will get in touch with Production and see what can be done ._x000D_

Good morning Jim ,_x000D_
_x000D_
This is an interesting request ( I would think do-able)  ,  I am checking to verify ._x000D_
Was there a particular color your customer is looking for ? A stock color or a custom color?_x000D_
Normally the minimum quantity for a custom mood cup  per color is going to be 5,000  pcs , so I imagine that will stay the same ._x000D_
I should have a firm  answer for you shortly , but If you have any of the particulars they are looking for that would help ._x000D_

Hi Spencer, thanks for contacting us yesterday and congrats on the new business!

Typically we ask distributors to obtain yearly sales of $10-15K to receive our EQP program. However, we will be extending this program to you for the remainder of 2012 with a goal of $1,000 by end of December 2012. We will then review your sales to see if we will be renewing for 2013.

 

Our EQP program is 5% off first column, and EQP at second break or more.
Let us know if you have any questions, thanks!

The charges you refer to below where NOT quoted when I called to confirm pricing and availability.  That is why they are not on our P.O. and are unquoted charges._x000D_

To me an ideal supplier would offer high-end branded quality merchandise, at a fair price and multiple decoration options for that merchandise. They would also be pro-active in our relationship and want to learn about my customer base before suggesting items to me that are not relevant to my clients. A true partnership with that supplier would be rewarding to us both._x000D_

This event is a perfect example of a different way to approach this business that I've been a part of for over 22 years. I've used the normal rep vendor engagements in the past with mixed results.I Have seen great strides with the apparel side of my vendor relationships in the past way more than the hard good companies. I'm hopeful this format will help me forge better vendor relationships and visa versa._x000D_

Orders will be coming from and billing to National Design.  Our POs from Jacob Saewert read “National Design – San Diego division” (in upper left corner) for you to tell apart from National Pen’s POs, but otherwise they look identical.  Invoices should be sent to Megan Price at MPrice@pens.com<mailto:MPrice@pens.com> ._x000D_
_x000D_
For drop ship carton quantity, please advise if you can manage 12 pcs cartons for our client wanting 450 pcs total.   They are a state park concessionaire with no warehousing, and cannot accept 50 pcs masters.   It may mean losing the order.   They can pay the drop ship $3 fee, but need smaller masters.   Thanks._x000D_
_x000D_
Well noted on pre-ticket charge of $0.095 each.  Thanks._x000D_
_x000D_
Megan - please note that you must indicate customer PO # in instructions of order for Aakron to indicate it on master cartons._x000D_
Otherwise, they will use National Design’s PO # on master cartons.  Thanks._x000D_

Good morning Doug ,_x000D_
_x000D_
I just want to confirm that the orders will be coming from and billing to National Design . If so we will just need to know where you would like the invoices to go . We normally will set up the “new” accounts when we receive the first order , so if you would copy me in when you send your order to Orders@aakronline.com<mailto:Orders@aakronline.com> for the first time I will be sure that you are flagged as being part of National Pen ._x000D_
_x000D_
-All orders are Blind Shipped /From our Client_x000D_
- Drop ship charge add $ 3.00 per Drop_x000D_
- A label is placed on all boxes with shipping information  . As long as you tell us to reference the Clients PO # under the Attention field this will be on the label ._x000D_
-Packing slip is included with our client as shipper and your end user as ship to ._x000D_
_x000D_
Packaging for the 67220- 20 Oz Sun Fun Bottle Below :_x000D_
50 Per Box            22” x 13” x 14”  9 #_x000D_
100 Per Box        19” x 19” x 24”   21 #_x000D_
_x000D_
50 Per box would be the smallest amount to ship safely , This is a full case quantity ._x000D_
_x000D_
As far as the Label charge , the $ .05 is based off National Pen Supplying the UPC Label . If Aakron Line were to supply the label then the charge is $ .095 each ._x000D_
_x000D_
I will pass the information that you have given me as far as Primary Contacts , and invoice and freight contacts ._x000D_
_x000D_
Please let me know if you need anything further for this order ._x000D_

Mike and Michelle – good news.   Although we haven’t obtained an order for Candy tins or Mood Straws yet, we quoted one of our retail customers National Pen’s drink ware item # DKW-11206 – 20 oz. Sun Fun Cycle Bottle and won the job._x000D_
_x000D_
We now have an order to process with you.  So, I need to cover some details to establish another account quickly to involve another buyer in our company, and assure our retail customers do not get National Pen carton markings, logos, or collateral inserted._x000D_
_x000D_
For Retail customer’s, our line is branded - National Design.   Our purchasing agent is named Jacob Saewert.   He works for National Pen too.   However, our customers for Retail almost always require:_x000D_
      -           Blind ship or as National Design_x000D_
      -           Multiple drop ships within an order which I know there are up charges to pay_x000D_
      -           Customer’s PO # on carton markings_x000D_
      -           Packing slip_x000D_
_x000D_
We prefer for National Design orders that your point of contact for POs, payment details, invoicing, and inquiries be Jacob Saewert.  Since you are already setup in National Pen’s system we can cut orders to you and make payments, but please confirm if you need any further details from us to send invoices?_x000D_
_x000D_
For this 450 pcs drink ware order we have currently for item # DKW-11206, please provide the master carton pack out info (Qty per master, size, weight)_x000D_
We would also like to know what is the min quantity you can accept as a drop ship count within an order?  In other words, what is the smallest master case that safely ship water bottles?_x000D_
_x000D_
Lastly, I believe the pre-ticket or UPC labeling cost is $0.05 each, but please confirm that too.  Thank you._x000D_

Well  I’m happy to hear that you liked our alternative option to what you were originally looking for ._x000D_
The snack line is pretty much new for AAkron  , but year to date the Jelly Belly beans have been the more popular seller . The item number for the Jelly Belly beans in the  round window tin would be # 00608  these come in cases of 48 pcs (15” x 10” x 4” ) and weigh 16 lbs._x000D_
National Pen price for a 1 color imprint on the lid would be $ 3.57 each net and then a $ 36.00 Net set up charge . On Exact repeats  the set ups would be waived ._x000D_
If you were to order over catalog quantity(528 pcs) then you would need to contact us for a large volume quote  .  I can work this up if you need it , I just do not want to put the cart before the horse ._x000D_
We do offer other fills for our tins as well  , so if this is a problem let us know and we could offer something else ._x000D_
_x000D_
Also just as  a side note on our UPC label conversation -If we were to apply a sticker provided by National pen then the cost would be reduced to $ .05 each ._x000D_

Hello Doug,_x000D_
_x000D_
I have entered the sample order to ship via 2 day service and this will most likely ship tomorrow . We offer a different style of tin with mints ,but it does indeed twist off as well . As we have a limited supply of the sample snack items , the round tins actually come with Jelly beans in them  . I will send a separately wrapped package of the mints that you will be able to show your client , and let them sample.  We are including one of every color of the mood straw as well for your clients review ._x000D_
Neither of these particular items is considered for a childs use per say , however we do have the General conformity cert. on all of our items ._x000D_
We do have inner and master packaging details  for both items and are capable of providing special packaging . Packaging would need to be quoted based on what is needed by the client ._x000D_
_x000D_
If you have further questions please feel free to reach out ._x000D_

Thank you, Michelle._x000D_
_x000D_
Orders will be coming from and billing to National Design.  Our POs from Jacob Saewert read “National Design – San Diego division” (in upper left corner) for you to tell apart from National Pen’s POs, but otherwise they look identical.  Invoices should be sent to Megan Price at MPrice@pens.com<mailto:MPrice@pens.com> ._x000D_
_x000D_
For drop ship carton quantity, please advise if you can manage 12 pcs cartons for our client wanting 450 pcs total.   They are a state park concessionaire with no warehousing, and cannot accept 50 pcs masters.   It may mean losing the order.   They can pay the drop ship $3 fee, but need smaller masters.   Thanks._x000D_
_x000D_
Well noted on pre-ticket charge of $0.095 each.  Thanks._x000D_
_x000D_
Megan - please note that you must indicate customer PO # in instructions of order for Aakron to indicate it on master cartons._x000D_
Otherwise, they will use National Design’s PO # on master cartons.  Thanks._x000D_

Good morning Doug ,_x000D_
_x000D_
I just want to confirm that the orders will be coming from and billing to National Design . If so we will just need to know where you would like the invoices to go . We normally will set up the “new” accounts when we receive the first order , so if you would copy me in when you send your order to Orders@aakronline.com<mailto:Orders@aakronline.com> for the first time I will be sure that you are flagged as being part of National Pen ._x000D_
_x000D_
-All orders are Blind Shipped /From our Client_x000D_
- Drop ship charge add $ 3.00 per Drop_x000D_
- A label is placed on all boxes with shipping information  . As long as you tell us to reference the Clients PO # under the Attention field this will be on the label ._x000D_
-Packing slip is included with our client as shipper and your end user as ship to ._x000D_
_x000D_
Packaging for the 67220- 20 Oz Sun Fun Bottle Below :_x000D_
50 Per Box            22” x 13” x 14”  9 #_x000D_
100 Per Box        19” x 19” x 24”   21 #_x000D_
_x000D_
50 Per box would be the smallest amount to ship safely , This is a full case quantity ._x000D_
_x000D_
As far as the Label charge , the $ .05 is based off National Pen Supplying the UPC Label . If Aakron Line were to supply the label then the charge is $ .095 each ._x000D_
_x000D_
I will pass the information that you have given me as far as Primary Contacts , and invoice and freight contacts ._x000D_
_x000D_
Please let me know if you need anything further for this order ._x000D_

Mike and Michelle – good news.   Although we haven’t obtained an order for Candy tins or Mood Straws yet, we quoted one of our retail customers National Pen’s drink ware item # DKW-11206 – 20 oz. Sun Fun Cycle Bottle and won the job._x000D_
_x000D_
We now have an order to process with you.  So, I need to cover some details to establish another account quickly to involve another buyer in our company, and assure our retail customers do not get National Pen carton markings, logos, or collateral inserted._x000D_
_x000D_
For Retail customer’s, our line is branded - National Design.   Our purchasing agent is named Jacob Saewert.   He works for National Pen too.   However, our customers for Retail almost always require:_x000D_
      -           Blind ship or as National Design_x000D_
      -           Multiple drop ships within an order which I know there are up charges to pay_x000D_
      -           Customer’s PO # on carton markings_x000D_
      -           Packing slip_x000D_
_x000D_
We prefer for National Design orders that your point of contact for POs, payment details, invoicing, and inquiries be Jacob Saewert.  Since you are already setup in National Pen’s system we can cut orders to you and make payments, but please confirm if you need any further details from us to send invoices?_x000D_
_x000D_
For this 450 pcs drink ware order we have currently for item # DKW-11206, please provide the master carton pack out info (Qty per master, size, weight)_x000D_
We would also like to know what is the min quantity you can accept as a drop ship count within an order?  In other words, what is the smallest master case that safely ship water bottles?_x000D_
_x000D_
Lastly, I believe the pre-ticket or UPC labeling cost is $0.05 each, but please confirm that too.  Thank you._x000D_

Doug ,_x000D_
_x000D_
Well  I’m happy to hear that you liked our alternative option to what you were originally looking for ._x000D_
The snack line is pretty much new for AAkron  , but year to date the Jelly Belly beans have been the more popular seller . The item number for the Jelly Belly beans in the  round window tin would be # 00608  these come in cases of 48 pcs (15” x 10” x 4” ) and weigh 16 lbs._x000D_
National Pen price for a 1 color imprint on the lid would be $ 3.57 each net and then a $ 36.00 Net set up charge . On Exact repeats  the set ups would be waived ._x000D_
If you were to order over catalog quantity(528 pcs) then you would need to contact us for a large volume quote  .  I can work this up if you need it , I just do not want to put the cart before the horse ._x000D_
We do offer other fills for our tins as well  , so if this is a problem let us know and we could offer something else ._x000D_
_x000D_
Also just as  a side note on our UPC label conversation -If we were to apply a sticker provided by National pen then the cost would be reduced to $ .05 each ._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you,_x000D_

My team here says they can’t alter the logo per team and were asked to include the sponsor tagline “presented by…”._x000D_
_x000D_
So we have to try to give it our best shot and hope letter A’s don’t fill.   If your team can enlarge to max imprint size, that’d be great._x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, please note the team is needing in hands Jun 19th in California.   PO and art coming today.   Thanks._x000D_

Good morning Doug ,_x000D_
_x000D_
Well this is a great way to start my Monday !  I’m glad your customer liked the samples and is proceeding with an order ._x000D_
I did want to warn you that some of the print is borderline of being too small so we may lose some of the clarity of the inside of the letters .( Like the A’s ) It will still be readable , just not as crisp as they may like . Can this be altered at all ?_x000D_

Well, actually they only want 1 color imprint. But 100 of them get blue imprint, 100 gets green and 100 gets coral. So it’s the ink change and PMS match charges I am concerned about. Hope this makes sense._x000D_

Oh darn , we do not offer Multicolor on this because of the registration . WE would have to go Full color digital and we definitely can not hit this pricing that way ._x000D_
Otherwise I would have waived those charges away for you ._x000D_
Sorry we can not help you on this one Karen ._x000D_

Thank you,_x000D_

Hi again! Hope you’re not sick of me yet. ?_x000D_

OK, so I ran the numbers and I don’t think I will be able to use this bag as a substitute only because my client wants to run the logo in three different colors. All three colors are PMS matched. Bullet doesn’t charge for any of that…_x000D_
_x000D_
I don’t know if there is anything you can do to help with that but I just wanted to let you know. I am a member of AI Masterminds pricing group so I get the EQP (yay!)._x000D_

Let me know please and thanks!_x000D_

I agree , it’s a great place to get to know people a bit better too . I had  been positing a picture of my fur babies before I found your post . I’m glad we are able to help you out with this order  !_x000D_
_x000D_
As far as self promotions go Aakron does offer great pricing ~20 % off end quantity pricing on most items and any set ups charges are reduced to $ 20.00  .  We have been running a weekly self promo , I have attached the latest one under my signature . As this is a newer item  I am not sure how it will take off ._x000D_
Some of our top PSA sellers are below . Really anyone of our Mood items I think would be a hit between the vibrant colors and the fact that it changes colors ,Sure to catch everyones attention  !_x000D_

I hope all is well and you have some good plans for this upcoming weekend !_x000D_

If I am ever able to assist you with virtual’s , high quantity quotes or ideas please feel free to call on me ._x000D_
The reason for my email is  I that our item 16120 for the  Sleek Pen Stylus has been a pretty good seller for you  , however it is being discontinued in 2016 .  We do have a new Pen coming out the Metallic Fujo Pen/Stylus that we feel may make a fine replacement . I have attached a flyer illustrating  some of its finer points ._x000D_

I was wondering if you know how many pens might ship this week. They are asking just about every day. I told them 9000 will be delivered tomorrow. They are concerned that only shipping 10,000 pens per week will take another 20 weeks to complete the order._x000D_

WE currently have a low stock on this item, so I quoted a little bit longer lead time as it would take about 2 weeks to receive more product in from our vendor ._x000D_

   Unless you've given me the wrong item number your price should be .25(c). You do get eqp and we didn't raise our price on that so I'm a bit confused. I'll be out of the office next week but you can check that price again with Amanda Cummings acummings@aakronrule. com_x000D_

         Hi Tony-_x000D_
_x000D_
         I have an order for the 82-34000, 500 qty.  Unfortunately I quoted the client at the end of 2010.  Since there was a price increase, it put me in a bind.  She is a good client and I can’t raise the cost on her due to budget concerns.  So is there any way I can get special pricing on that item just for this order?  I know it is one of the exceptions to our special pricing…_x000D_

It was great to see you and Eric at the PPAI show this week._x000D_
_x000D_
As I explained, we have sent our communications to Laurie over the last several months.  Since we never received a bounce back that she is no longer with the company, we did not know she left._x000D_
_x000D_
Attached is your 2015 pricing program.   If we need to work up any special pricing for packaging, quantities, etc. please let either myself or Michelle Finnigan know and we would more than happy to work them up for you._x000D_
_x000D_
As promised, I also included the industry code report that I showed you at the show.  These are the industry codes we utilize and we can share with you the top selling items for each of these industry segments._x000D_
_x000D_
When you have a moment, could you please send us:_x000D_
_x000D_
      1.       Catalog release dates & product cut off dates.   As we introduce items, we can make sure we share with you any new product additions during the year_x000D_
      2.       Your current street address for the samples you requested.   I updated my iPad, but during the syncing process the changes did get overwritten on my iPad._x000D_

I look forward to your reply and we are excited about further developing our partnership in 2015._x000D_

Hello,

Wow! You never know, you have to keep talking to the customer! 

Carrie – print the 1,000 of the Yukon pen that you have in stock and ship asap to the Connecticut address.

It would be great if they could receive them sooner than the cut off date of 1/7 so they don’t have to overnite anything once they receive them.  

Customer said he will only need 1,000 for the event in Florida – 

Ship the balance of 4,000 in January – standard production first opportunity in January.

Please advise us the day the stock arrives from customs.

Thank you,

Christine

Christine,

 

Per our conversation, here is an alternative option incase the stock held up in customs does not come through in time:

 

80-15300- Apollo - @ .54/ea net

 

The grips are a bit different, but the chrome trim and white barrel are the same as the Yukon.

 

Let me know what you think, we are good on stock for this item, we'll talk on the 28th.

Thanks,
Carrie

Hi, 

 

I know we get EQP with you, but I have a customer that is wanting to do a one color imprint on 2 sides on the 70017. Is that possible? What is the run charge for the 2nd side? Thanks.

Just to be clear for your response this was an actual order that was placed for 100 pcs , Not a sample order_x000D_
If the client wasn’t happy , I would want to be sure they understood we would stand behind our product . Maybe they did get some bad items …_x000D_

I looked at a bunch of samples of this item and did not see an issue with this .    As we have a 15 day window for complaints I suggest they send pictures to back up there claim . Depending on what we find we might replace the order or credit a portion  for 100 pcs  ._x000D_

Hi Mike,_x000D_
_x000D_
I hope you are doing well. I want to pass along some comments from our client that were from a survey we send to clients after orders.  She ordered hand sanitizers on our PO# 24696-1._x000D_
These comments pertain to the question:_x000D_
_x000D_
The goods received were of the quality I expected. She gave it 2 out of 5. (5 is the best)_x000D_
_x000D_
Comments : I was not happy with the quality of the product. I don't see us using that item again. The tops did not fit tight and some of the stickers were not applied straight and were coming off.  Just not a quality item for the price that we have to charge._x000D_
_x000D_
This is a Salvation Army conference center. They sell our products in a gift store. Her concern was that the tops would open in a ladies purse or man’s pocket and make a mess._x000D_
I think that is what happened in the shipping box to a few in this order._x000D_
_x000D_
I called her to thank her for her reply and I told her I would pass along the comments to you.  She was not asking for anything else._x000D_
I have not received any other similar comments so I assume this is not a common problem._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you,_x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
_x000D_
I really like it here and agree it’ll be for the better._x000D_
_x000D_
Here’s the company history or what I know of it._x000D_
Transform Technologies bought Brainstorm about 1.5 years ago.  They also own Palm 1 Medical, but I don’t think they are ordering promotional products yet.   All the companies have their accounting here in Lawrenceville which is Transform Technologies, but maintain their separate identities for our clients.  For our overall spend we do need to try and combine the companies if we can._x000D_
_x000D_
Some other companies are putting everything under Transform.  If you need to do it just let me know and I’ll make notes in our system to make sure the orders come from Transform._x000D_
_x000D_
I think we have an order coming your way for mood pencils and rulers.  At least we did on Friday._x000D_
_x000D_
I hope that helps_x000D_

Well I’m sorry to hear about your position at Inkhead , but as Mike and I learned where one door closes another opens ._x000D_
In my experience it was a blessing and I should have shut that darn door a couple years sooner  !_x000D_
_x000D_
I look forward to working with you again Sam , and  I do have a couple questions for you . I am showing Brainstorm and Transform Technologies as 2 separate accounts . Will Brainstorms PO’s be coming in as Transform Technologies now ?  Or will they stay 2 separate entities ?_x000D_
As you know we are only 2 months into the trial EQP , but sales are only at $ 215.00  for Brainstorm . WE have a little hurdle to overcome , and I want to be sure the accounts are set up correctly ._x000D_
_x000D_
If we are able to help in any way just let us know ._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you,_x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
_x000D_
It’s been a few months.  In my last life I worked at InkHead, well they let me go at the end of last year.  I was shocked but I’ve moved on.  I’m here with Brainstorm working out of The Transform Group’s office in Lawrenceville, GA.  I was happy to see we were on EQP and you are our inside contact._x000D_
_x000D_
I hope our EQP trial status is working out and we can continue it on.  I’m using Sage and doing the product sourcing and setting up the presentations for our sales force.  I’ll be the one to schedule vendor visits to the Lawrenceville office too._x000D_
_x000D_
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help._x000D_
_x000D_
Thanks and have a great day_x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
_x000D_
I meant to call you today and now it’s about 5:30, too late.  The last order that we repeated was done in 2013, not 2012.  No matter what I do have to reprint these in the right orientation.  I was hoping you could give a  discount on the repeat order.  We’ll fix our art and send in a new PO._x000D_

Please let me know what we can do_x000D_

Good morning Sam ,_x000D_
_x000D_
We do not save our samples from orders that are 2 years old  ,but I did find the tag from this years run and as you stated it was made correctly . I looked up the previous order 214370-3 and the art as you say matches what we sent on PO 254756-403822 as well . As we have made them to the artwork approved,  what I can offer to do, is make sure that we mark this order so any future orders are produced with the hole punch on the opposite side of the tag . Away from the money and as depicted in the picture you had sent over to me ._x000D_
It may be the way the picture was taken , but it appears the tag on the top is bolder than the one we sent this year as well ._x000D_
_x000D_
I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused your customer , but as you said this order was made correctly ._x000D_
Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns ._x000D_

I see Dee is out of the office, I emailed her a problem I have with an order and I need your help.  Since I sent it I have a photo showing the imprint on the old as well as the new order.  You can see it is printed on opposite sides so they can hole punch the old one but not the new one.  We did reference the previous order on the PO._x000D_

Hi Dee,_x000D_
_x000D_
I’m not sure who to email on dispute orders.  Here is an iffy dispute, I don’t know if you can help me or not.  You have produced the same key tag for our client 5 times now.  The last order was 214370-333516.  I’m hoping you can find some notes or a sample of it.  Here is the situation-_x000D_
The $25 amount near the connector is too close to the numbers to be able to punch them out.  Our client is saying you’ve always printed them with the $ amounts away from the ring connection until this order.  I have no idea if this is true or not._x000D_
_x000D_
I will confess that when I look over the art used over the years we didn’t make the connector show in the early days.  The last two orders our art did have the same art as this order but our client is saying you produced them the opposite way.  This year you followed the art and he can’t use them._x000D_
_x000D_
Let me know what you think about this and what we can do._x000D_

Your quote file has been updated to reflect Mike’s offer . The PMS color match fee will be waived and the Set ups on New and repeat orders will also be waived moving forward for this program  ._x000D_
Our order entry team should catch this , however it would not hurt to have a note on these PO’s that state “see quote.”_x000D_

For items that are part of the Anthem program, we will not charge any set up charges for new orders and for repeat orders, there will not be any repeat set up charges.   If the PMS colors are the same for the brand and most of the colors have been for our standard ink colors, then there will not be any PMS matching charge for program items._x000D_
_x000D_
In terms of referencing anything, I believe that it will be noted on our internal program sheet that the CSR and OE team uses, so nothing will have be noted.   Michelle, what are your thoughts about this moving forward?_x000D_

It was great to talk to you a few minutes ago.  We are very excited to continue with the participation with this program.    To recap on our conversation, for items that are part of the Anthem program we will charge any set up charges and for exact reorders there not be any reorder set up charges.    As we explained, the only variable would be location personalization, which does not currently occur.  If something changes, we may have to adjust accordingly._x000D_

Just to nail down the copy change part – there would be no dealers/agents at this point who needed their names on items.  Maybe waaaay down the road, but that’s not a piece of business we’re discussing with them right now._x000D_

This program sounds like a fantastic opportunity as the acquire other brands and we want to help._x000D_
_x000D_
The question we had centered more about copy changes in the sense of personalization where they have a central logo and then it is personalized with dealer/location information.  For example, Amerigroup logo with copy for Robert Fiveash and them Amerigroup logo with copy for Mike Zingale.  This might not even apply, but from a set up perspective it is important because if we offer no charge set up and then there is dealer copy, it could cause an issue._x000D_

In terms of the flyer, yes, please let myself and Michelle know and we could coordinate the creation process._x000D_

Thanks so much.  We appreciate very much your working with us on this - it’s a tremendous help._x000D_
_x000D_
Regarding the copy changes, it’s all a bit of an unknown.  Anthem, like the other top insurance companies, is on a buying spree.  They purchased Amerigroup a few years ago (they were our client, and how we got in the door), announced the purchased Cigna a few months ago, etc.  As they integrate these brands into the Anthem mothership, there will be logo changes.  There will be changes as time goes by, but we cannot give you a sense for how often and with which brands – because they don’t/can’t provide that info to us.  If I had to guess, it would happen every few years.  Does that help at all?_x000D_
_x000D_
Also, we are trying to get Anthem/BF-branded sales flyers in the Anthem store – showing items that might not be approved yet, but that we may want to get in front of the buyers.  Who would we contact for assistance with those?_x000D_

That is fantastic news about the Anthem Program and the rebranding of their brands.    We are equally as excited to have participated in the program in the past and want to expand our presence moving forward._x000D_
_x000D_
I did review the letter that you sent over to Devin and on the surface, I am sure that we are going to be able to help since several items in our line do not have set up charges and we do not charge repeat set up charges on products.    I did have a couple of questions:_x000D_
_x000D_
Do you currently experience of foresee with their brand portfolio copy changes?_x000D_
If copy changes exist, are they typically one time opportunities or do they repeat?_x000D_
_x000D_
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this program in detail or if it is easier just reply to this email._x000D_

Thanks for working through this.  It’s not just you, this happens quite a bit which is why I am so cautious and specific with approval.  I think we are good to go with knowing you have and will print the process cyan.  I don’t want to go through you having to run another spec sample and wait.  Are you able to take an image of the first off the press and send that to us?  Are you able to take the sample of the one you show in the attached outside and take a picture of the logo after the glasses turned blue?_x000D_

Well its sorry I am , for the confusion on this color . I’m not sure why the art department would be giving me incorrect information , however Now I went to the production team and they tell me we can do this . I attached an example of what they would look like with the Panatone card . Please let us know how you would like to proceed ._x000D_

I want to be very clear that Process Blue and Process Cyan are NOT the same colors.  I am attaching an image from my PMS book showing the two colors side by side.  Also, below is a link further explaining the two._x000D_

With that said, you may be calling Process Blue something different as a standard color, however we MUST be sure if that is the case.  Please further investigate to confirm and let us know._x000D_

Speaking with our art department the Process Cyann you are requesting is the same as our Process Blue as shown in the imprint colors I sent over to you . If its okay with you ,we will move forward using this to provide a new proof . Did you need a the actual product again , or is a picture okay ?_x000D_

Below are the imprint colors we have , we went with the darker as you wanted to be closest to Process Cyan ._x000D_
We are able to match PMS colors ,There is a $32.00 charge per order .If that is what they need then that would most likely be the best way to proceed ._x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
Before running another sample, would you be able to send an image showing the 1082? What is the PMS equivalent?_x000D_
_x000D_
Our client’s brand color is Process Cyan, and they are very particular. If we can’t get very close to Process Cyan with one of your stock colors, I’m not sure it’s going to work. That being said, can you PMS match?_x000D_
_x000D_
Just received the sample, and imprint looks good, but the color is off. The color is too blue (compared to Process Cyan)._x000D_

Thanks for working through this.  It’s not just you, this happens quite a bit which is why I am so cautious and specific with approval.  I think we are good to go with knowing you have and will print the process cyan.  I don’t want to go through you having to run another spec sample and wait.  Are you able to take an image of the first off the press and send that to us?  Are you able to take the sample of the one you show in the attached outside and take a picture of the logo after the glasses turned blue?_x000D_

Well its sorry I am , for the confusion on this color . I’m not sure why the art department would be giving me incorrect information , however Now I went to the production team and they tell me we can do this . I attached an example of what they would look like with the Panatone card . Please let us know how you would like to proceed ._x000D_

I want to be very clear that Process Blue and Process Cyan are NOT the same colors.  I am attaching an image from my PMS book showing the two colors side by side.  Also, below is a link further explaining the two._x000D_
_x000D_

With that said, you may be calling Process Blue something different as a standard color, however we MUST be sure if that is the case.  Please further investigate to confirm and let us know._x000D_

Speaking with our art department the Process Cyann you are requesting is the same as our Process Blue as shown in the imprint colors I sent over to you . If its okay with you ,we will move forward using this to provide a new proof . Did you need a the actual product again , or is a picture okay ?_x000D_

Below are the imprint colors we have , we went with the darker as you wanted to be closest to Process Cyan ._x000D_
We are able to match PMS colors ,There is a $32.00 charge per order .If that is what they need then that would most likely be the best way to proceed ._x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
Before running another sample, would you be able to send an image showing the 1082? What is the PMS equivalent?_x000D_
_x000D_
Our client’s brand color is Process Cyan, and they are very particular. If we can’t get very close to Process Cyan with one of your stock colors, I’m not sure it’s going to work. That being said, can you PMS match?_x000D_
_x000D_
Just received the sample, and imprint looks good, but the color is off. The color is too blue (compared to Process Cyan)._x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I noticed on your most recent quote featuring the 12K and 15K quantities that the run charge for an imprint on the second glove was missing.  Would this charge be waived on those quantities?  Would there still be a set up charge for those quantities, as well?  Just wanted to make sure._x000D_

Hello Pat ,_x000D_
_x000D_
I am so sorry , I sent the  2 boxes of them out yesterday , I felt so bad it took so long to get them out to you in the first place . With the ASI Orlando and then this show it really put us behind the eight ball in the samples department ._x000D_
If you would like to send this information to me though I can add it to our quote file for future reference ._x000D_

Thanks so much for thinking of BI.  If not too late could I send you our reps. addresses so that the kits can be sent directly to them?  We are in Atlanta and we have reps. all over the country.  We find shipping directly to them saves a lot of time._x000D_

I am sorry for the later reply, both myself and Michelle were at the ASI Orlando show._x000D_
_x000D_
We do have our full catalog available as a zoom catalog..  Here is the link to our 2015 AAkron eCatalog<http://www.zoomcatalog.com/catalogs/aakron-line-2015#/1/>.  Would this work for your team?_x000D_
_x000D_
If not, we could explore other options, but with low res catalog files, the images might be blurry and the text may not be legible._x000D_
_x000D_
Keep us posted on what the next step should be._x000D_

    Very sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  Still playing catch up from the holidays and trade shows!  As you may know, my reps all use iPads now for their customer calls.  Can you see that a LOW RES PDF of your 2015 catalog is uploaded to the following site using the link below or forward to someone who can?  Let me know if you have questions or if there’s anything I can do for you.  As always, thanks for your help and looking forward to working with you both in 2015!_x000D_

They were super cool about it – felt bad for springing it on me…and making me waste time trying to make it happen :)_x000D_
_x000D_
And yes, I lived in Atlanta for 10 years (working at Capital Ideas for 8 of them).  I grew up here, though, and my husband and I really wanted to move back west at some point with our two young boys…so I asked if I could work remotely full time (I used to work from home a day or two a week) and was super lucky that they said yes!  We’ve been back for almost 2 ½ years now and it’s worked out great!_x000D_

Sorry – TMI, par usual…but there you go!  Have a nice day, Michelle – and thanks again!_x000D_

Awww – thanks, lady!  Right back at you!  And unfortunately, after wasting a lot of time, they ended up having to scratch the whole order – because the freight would have been over $350 to get them overnighted here to MT by tomorrow or even by (shipping via 2-day) for Friday.  I work remotely…like WAY remotely so there weren’t any vendors with a 24 hr ship that were anywhere near the vicinity!  Sigh.  Oh well – it is what it is.  I tried :)_x000D_

Thank you so much – and no worries!!  I actually had to place the order with a vendor that was slightly less and had unbreakable (plastic) straws so the youngest kids wouldn’t hurt themselves.  I would have rather gone w/ you guys, but in actuality, it was probably more of a pain in your you-know-what than anything :)_x000D_

Sorry I am just getting back to you Jacq , I left early yesterday and my email blew up !_x000D_
The straw that we have pictured (Hard Acrylic) is the only one that we have available for this item  ._x000D_
The estimated freight to 30328 for the 90 pcs would be $ 41.00 ._x000D_
Your PSA pricing is  $ 2.094 less 20 % which would be 1.676 then your set up will be $ 20.00 net ._x000D_
If we get the PO  today they would ship tomorrow and it is a 1 day transit from TN so we should be good  ._x000D_
We just would need the first order by 4:30 today if possible ._x000D_

Hi again – and hope you had a nice Monday, lady!!  So the owners of my sons Montessori decided they wanted to (most likely) go with your 24 hr turn acrylic tumblers # 74016.  Two questions, though – do you happen to offer a soft straw for these (vs the hard acrylic ones)?  Also, with the PSA pricing you so nicely offered, what would our net be for 90 pcs with a 1c imprint?  We’ll obviously need to overnight (so if you could get est freight costs, too, that’d be great), as the goods must deliver this Thurs, 6.09 :)_x000D_

Hello Jessica ,_x000D_
_x000D_
One more quick question  . Most of our items have two part numbers , the standard number and then the Full color digital option .  (So example our 69012 wine glass if printed Full color is 8069012 )_x000D_
For this opportunity do we treat these as one part number or would you prefer that we offer just our 1 color item number  or Full color item number as the item submitted._x000D_

No, you do not need to break them up into baseline and basics. We will do that internally._x000D_

1       Do we need to break out the lists into sections as basics and baseline?_x000D_
2       Were you looking for our top 25, top 50, top 10 items for each segment.   We are also going to be introducing a midyear update, several items are available now and others will arrive shortly.   Should we include this list as well?_x000D_

Hi Preferred Supplier,_x000D_
_x000D_
As I may have mentioned to you in person we are looking at trimming down our standard catalog and making it the best possible selection while keeping a manageable number of SKU’s. This catalog is used as a starting point for all programs._x000D_
_x000D_
Our catalog will be broken up into two segments, basics and baseline. The baseline collection will still be considered our highest recommendations and will be what stock recommendations will be pulled from. The basics will be a broader selection. I will be limiting SKU’s from each supplier so please don’t send me your entire list. You can upload a spreadsheet if you would like to but make sure that each column is represented. Multiline reps, please include one form PER line you are submitting. Please submit by 5/25._x000D_
_x000D_
https://form.jotform.com/81414379921157_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I look forward to your participation. You will be notified of final selection so all products can be appropriately documented._x000D_

Ok, I see online now about the fee.

 

I think this is simple enough art, so we will skip the proof.

 

Thanks!

Hi Ladies, it looks like Sandy is assigned to this order and she had asked approval of the eproof charge on this writing instrument of $40/net. 

Would you like to approve this charge? We have to physically print a sample vs. creating it on computer screen as we are printing your exact art/fonts emailed on an old printing method. 

 

Also, it looks like sandy was emailing info@coastalconnections, would you like me to make a note on your account to contact another email on questions on po’s?

The first one is after our trip to the zoo, the second is him reminding me of how cute his little toes are and the last one is the ""language"" he speaks, which we suspect is a combination of Russian, Chinese and Martian ;)_x000D_

As Ann has probably told you, we are interested in adding the 59110 single wine bottle bag to our assortment. Can you please confirm the price as $1.260(C), the MOQ as 100, and set-up costs as $50 (G)...as well as any other shipping and handling fees applicable?_x000D_

_x000D_
Since we anticipate selling to smaller groups a lower minimum would be helpful. Please let me know if that's possible._x000D_

No worries, that happens to all of us! Thanks for being so responsive once you realized what happened._x000D_
_x000D_

You ask very good questions. Right now I'm trying to get the info around what our customers want us to add, so I don't know. Obviously, all of our apparel dwarfs any of our promotional merchandise but of the categories we offer that are not apparel, drinkware is followed by bags then drinkware. Our other categories have a much smaller percentage of sales, though our new tech accessories category is giving our current top sellers a run for its money._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
We do know that small and medium businesses, celebratory occasions, K12 (schools) and sports teams buy most of our non-apparel product, so this may help focus your suggestions._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Because much of CustomInk's focus has been on apparel, we will be leaning on your expertise a bit to help steer us in the right direction._x000D_

Before I answer, I owe you an apology.   I am terrible about going thru my spam folder and for some reason your email to me last week went to my spam folder.   I pride myself on getting back quick to my customers, maybe a sore spot from my distributor days when people would not return a call or email.   If you ever email me and I do not respond, never hesitate to reach out to me again.   I am sorry that we started off like that._x000D_

I know the main focus is on the soft goods side of the business, that is the mother ship.   In terms of hard goods, you have a few categories now like Drinkware, Technology, Writing Instruments.   What is are you popular categories and where have your clients asked for product line expansion?_x000D_

Thanks Mike, look forward to meeting you as well. In terms of timing, I am building out a plan for the year so any categories or products you can suggest now would be great as we get our tentative plan outlined. We hope to have things nailed down in the next couple of weeks, so the more information you can provide me sooner the better._x000D_
_x000D_
What I'm looking for are new categories that could be volume drivers as well as additional product we can add to our existing assortment. For each suggestion I'll need to know what the best sellers are, seasonality, and how a new category breaks down (ex. within bags totes are x% of sales, duffels y%, and so on). Trends are also important as well as understanding which brands drive traffic._x000D_

Hi Mike,_x000D_
_x000D_
How about May 19th at 10:00 AM?_x000D_
_x000D_
It would be helpful if you could give Jeanette a general overview of Aakron. We'd also be eager to hear what your best selling product categories are and the top sellers particularly in drinkware, pens, tech accessories and coolers.  These are all categories we are currently reviewing to update and expand our offering._x000D_
In the short term we are looking to add some Wine bags fairly quickly.  Would it be possible for you to send us a sample of the NW Single Wine Bottle Bag #59110 and the NW Double Bottle Wine Bag # 59120?_x000D_
_x000D_
I've also copied Jeanette here so you have her email address._x000D_

Hi Mike,_x000D_
_x000D_
I hope your are well. I wanted to let your know that we are excited to have a new merchant on board, Jeanette Keene, who will be responsible for expanding our hard goods product assortment. This responsibility was formerly held by Kate Clarke who will now focus on apparel only._x000D_
I was wondering if you had plans to be in our area soon and could stop by to meet Jeanette and give her an overview of Aakron and your product assortment.  If not, let's set up a call so I can introduce her to you._x000D_

I have a potential order request of up to 15k pieces, so I wanted to see if you all could handle that kind of request for a July 7th in-hands date.

Hi Trelbie, thanks for taking the time to chat with rep Amanda on our line! As discussed, we are extending EQP on a trial basis to you for six months. We ask that you reach a goal of $5,000 by mid-September of this year. We will then review sales at that time to either continue program, or provide pricing on certain items sold.

Would you like us to forward this to any other reps/branches? See program attached. EQP is back to first column; see exclusions on program sheet. Thanks so much!

      The art room has advised that with this printing method - we need  more white underneath the blue text in order for it to print, or switch to  black text - but I have worked with him on another option - we've outlined the  blue text with white and will work fine printing that way - please see  attached and let me know if we can proceed with this._x000D_

         The art room has asked that the blue text be changed to black;  blue  text needs a white underprint and the text is not thick enough  for that to  work. Please advise ASAP in order to proceed._x000D_

            Please see attached virtual - the   art  room has showed an ""as is"" image on the top that they are  saying  the words  will be illegible (specifically the last line  because the  font pt size is so  small). He has suggested the  lower image to enlarge  words and break them up to  be more  legible to  print._x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
_x000D_
We will not be placing the order. We found a local supplier that we can pick up from directly and save time and shipping. That was the difference. Your pricing is very competitive and we do plan on using you again in the future for smaller orders. Thank you for your time._x000D_

Hi Carrie,
 
My client called me Friday night to ask me to price out golf pencils as an alternative to the full size pencil below.
Please advise ASAP. I did remind him that we need a confirmed order today either way.
 
Thanks,
Jill

Hi Carrie,
 
Great speaking with you before. Here's the recap:
We need 150,000 white round pencils with a 1 color imprint (PMS match) delivered to 4 different warehouses by 1/15. I don't know the splits just yet. If it's easier, you can send the entire lot to me for delivery on 1/12, and we'll split them up and send them out.
 
They would prefer a white eraser, but will take pink if that's the only option. Please confirm.
Please advise separately the cost to polybag or shrinkwrap them in packs of 10.
Please advise add'l cost to presharpen the pencils but I will advise them against it because they may get dirty.  
 
If you can make the delivery as noted above, please send me samples of your white pencil for delivery tomorrow. If there's more than one style available, please send me the options. They do want a fairly inexpensive pencil. You can send the pencil samples to me overnight at the address below for receipt tomorrow. You can use my UPS acct # 823-W92 or my Fedex acct # 2049-0279-8.
 
 On the quote, please advise the timing and cost for a prepro sample as well as when you would need a confirmed order and how long you need for production (assume they will not be presharpened).
 
Please confirm receipt of this email and that the samples will be going out to me today.
 
Thanks!
Jill

Just met up with the purchasing dept, they have talked with our overseas vendors and the Camo tote bags were brought to the airport 9/21 - so we should be seeing the shipment middle of the week next week. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

Hi Tracey,

 

I have attached the overseas quote to do 6,000pcs printed and shipped air freight - let me know if you have any questions - running on lunch now.

We would need OK asap to get this order moving for overseas to shoot for a ship date of apx: Sept 25th - apx 2 weeks air freight....see est attached. 

 

For the 1,000pcs we have in-house for the end of Sept - we can offer $1.11/ea one-color/one side - and if you are to do the second side imprint, it would be $.28/ea net. (item#59090, all other charges not listed prevail from catalog/website).

Hi Tracey,

 

We did send out a new sample overnight to your client - 

1Z3841E90160818514

Did you hear from your client on an event date in Oct? I rec'd info from overseas and they would try to ship around Sept 25th - which it is apx 30 days on ocean - so that would take us to the end of Oct - and there are no guarantees on delivery dates pending customs clearing - I wanted to give you this info ahead of time - I cannot guarantee we'll meet an Oct date - We can look into airing them in which is a faster boat  (apx 2 weeks travel) - but that can get expensive. 

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed - I have the 1,000pcs Pink Camo in-house on hold right now.

The quote that Julie from customer service took was a request for the 59010 - Regular shopping tote - I apologize for the miscommunication - I'm not sure where it happened - but pricing for the CAMO tote - item#59090 of 7,000pcs is a ballpark of $1.11/net - one color/one side {second side imprint add: $.28/ea net). We have apx 1,000pcs available at this time in pink CAMO tote and the ones on order were just placed and we can add to that order to complete your order with the next shipment arriving in apx 2-3 months. We can also look into possibly printing your entire order overseas if that is something you are interested in. The price may come closer to that $.59/ea net for the 59010 Shopping tote; not sure though.

 

Depending on how you want to work things out - we have options of a using the green CAMO tote 59090 to supplement the order or our CAMO drawstring backpacks 59080 (same ballpark price of $1.11/ea net one-color/one side -apx 3,000pcs available at this time). Please let me know how you'd like to proceed; again, I truly apologize for the mix up.

_x000D_
I sent you an email with the flyer but, the logo that you sent me was either to large or  not high quality image. That is why it looks squashed together. If you have a different image, smaller and high quality I can fix it. I will keep playing with it but I wanted you to get an idea._x000D_

Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t explain that very well, the art that I sent is for the flyer itself, not to be put on the pencils ;o/_x000D_

Good Morning Sara,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I just have a couple questions about the art that you provided. It is considered to be full Color and the items on your special pricing is not full color items, they are one color imprints. Do you only want me to use the company name in one color to put on the Pencils?_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Pricing can't be put on the E-Flyer.   Would you like me to try to bet as low as $ .10 as a headline?_x000D_

The 253 purple will be great._x000D_
Last week was a wild one!  Didn’t get the month closed, so that is my goal for today, but first the billing must be finished, cash posted, checkbook balanced then I can close. It may be a long night!  On the positive side, if I am late closing then I know it was a good month._x000D_
_x000D_
We are definitely giving a try to do more with you & Mike, both have been so good to Headway – we need to repay you with business.  And maybe Mike will come visit us!  I just love him, he is one of the best, a good honest & sincere gentleman._x000D_
_x000D_
Here’s what I do on a weekly basis:_x000D_
Purple I work with a statewide home health & hospice company._x000D_
Lime for Crowne Health Care – assisted, skilled nursing facilities._x000D_
Red for a therapy services company operating in the assisted & skilled nursing facilities._x000D_
Light blue – therapy services for outpatients._x000D_
Navy or gray – hospital, they do a lot in the community._x000D_
Lime or teal – a small home care company_x000D_
Teal – several clients_x000D_
Full color – Daxko, they are a tech company that does the membership software for YMCA’s, plus now healthcare & gyms. They are now in 59 countries. Need to pay more attention to this one._x000D_
_x000D_
The new guy – is really having some success with orthodontics, so anything youth related. Also, purple/lime for a therapy/rehab company. Heating & cooling companies._x000D_

I hope you had a great 4th of July weekend and are off to a great start to your work week !_x000D_
I wanted to reach  out to  thank you for your support this year , you really are doing a great job selling the Aakron Line   !     I wanted to reach out and offer to extend End Quantity Pricing to Imperial Expressions  for the remaining of 2016 if you are interested .  Our EQP program recognizes and rewards our top clients for their continued partnership and support .  We do require a volume requirements for this program of $10,000 in sales annually. You are only about  $ 6,500  away to reaching that goal and having this program extended into 2017 . I believe that with the discounted pricing and  you may be able to meet or even exceed this !_x000D_
Please let me know if you are interested and we will get you set up today so you can start taking advantage of this great savings on our line of Promotional Products !_x000D_

The last few months have been busy for you.   A new baby boy (Drew is adorable) and now joining Facilis!  I am a firm believer that good things happen to good people and you are proving it._x000D_

Congratulations on joining the Facilis Group.   Myself and Michelle Finnigan are the points of contact for Facilis.   Our goal is to provide the support & tools to craft a mutually rewarding partnership._x000D_

To demonstrate this commitment, I have included a listing of the benefits that AAkron extends to all Facilis members which include no charge random samples, no charge spec samples, marketing support and much more.  Please feel free to share both with your sales team.  We have updated our systems to reflect the Facilis affiliation which will ensure the transition will be seamless._x000D_
_x000D_
In exchange, could you please send us the listing of your team for our records.  We would like to reach out to offer assistance with project ideas, samples or virtual images._x000D_

I wanted to let you know that there has been several changes with AAkron and our responsibilities.   I was the outside rep for AAkron, that is why you saw me at the CAAMP Show and the CAAMPFire events and Michelle was the inside contact._x000D_
_x000D_
Recently, myself and Michelle are going to be focusing our efforts on Strategic Accounts, specifically focused on the buying groups like AIM which you are a member of.     We are going to be offering a tag team approach to these groups where Michelle and myself have main responsibilities and we have hired a local rep Charlie Cochran who I included on this email as well.   Pending schedules, either myself or Charlie could look at attending your event._x000D_

Good Afternoon Joseph  ~ 2017 will be a special year for the AAkron family; AAkron Line is turning 50 years old.  We have come a long way from the two-car garage that was our first production and office space.   We would not have grown to the company we are today without the support of our customers like you._x000D_
_x000D_
AAkron Line is pleased to announce that Identify Yourself has qualified for our 2017 EQP Pricing Program.    This program recognizes and rewards our top clients for their continued partnership and support._x000D_
_x000D_
Attached are the program details & requirements for your records. The annual sales volume requirements for this program are $10,000.   To help ensure that we exceed this requirement for 2017, we can help with marketing support, program suggestions and much more.  Just let us know how we can help._x000D_
_x000D_
New for 2017, we added over 50 new products and we expanded the AAkron exclusive items to over 125 items.  AAkron is also trailblazing new printing techniques with the introduction of our Full Color Direct printing.  FCD Direct printing offers full color decorating on a growing list of drinkware items on either 1/side, 2/side or a full wrap full color printing for about the same price as 1/c imprinting and for the same set up charge.  Let us show you how you can capitalize on this growing trend so you can part of the FCD printing sales train._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you for the support over the years and we look forward to the next 50 years.   We look forward to making 2017 a success for all,  and further developing our partnership._x000D_

Good Morning Liz  ~ 2017 will be a special year for the AAkron family; AAkron Line is turning 50 years old.  We have come a long way from the two-car garage that was our first production and office space.   We would not have grown to the company we are today without the support of our customers like you._x000D_
_x000D_
AAkron Line is pleased to announce that Jeckil Promotions has qualified for our 2017 EQP Pricing Program.    This program recognizes and rewards our top clients for their continued partnership and support._x000D_
_x000D_
Attached are the program details & requirements for your records. The annual sales volume requirements for this program are $10,000.   To help ensure that we exceed this requirement for 2017, we can help with marketing support, program suggestions and much more.  Just let us know how we can help._x000D_
_x000D_
New for 2017, we added over 50 new products and we expanded the AAkron exclusive items to over 125 items.  AAkron is also trailblazing new printing techniques with the introduction of our Full Color Direct printing.  FCD Direct printing offers full color decorating on a growing list of drinkware items on either 1/side, 2/side or a full wrap full color printing for about the same price as 1/c imprinting and for the same set up charge.  Let us show you how you can capitalize on this growing trend so you can part of the FCD printing sales train._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you for the support over the years and we look forward to the next 50 years.   We look forward to making 2017 a success for all,  and further developing our partnership._x000D_

   Just to clarify: The artwork is good, useable and high res as needed._x000D_
_x000D_
   When I rec'd your art and sent it on to our artroom to check, they had to reduce your checkmarks from the gradients to a solid black check. They did not see the issue until proceeding with the actual eproof and noticed that part of your art file was not converted curves so the font was not coming through correctly when opened. When the art room compared your faxed copy to the art file we noticed the 3 is coming up wrong._x000D_
_x000D_
   I am sorry you feel this is unprofessional but we checked your art as you asked and the resolution and file was good and useable however until we could spend the few hours getting the order actually entered, corrected, and to the art room. We take many steps to ensure quality and accuracy. I would hope that you are happy that we brought the issue to your attention. It's a simple fix, either please open your file on your system where created and select all of the art file and convert to curves or outlines and resave to the font comes through or we can try and recreate the exact style._x000D_
_x000D_
   Being that there is not event date or firm ship date I don't see the big concern. We will obviously push this eproof through asap to make up for any lost time and produce this in as little as 7 days if needed. Please advise how you want to proceed, submit new art with converted to curves or let us know if you want us to recreate....attached is how the image is currently pulling up._x000D_

   We sent this artwork several days ago and requested that it be checked right away to ensure that it is correct -- this is a very large order and it is terribly unprofessional that we have to NOW tell client the artwork is not good.  You need to advise me of this right away -- I will see if the client is capable of converting these fonts - it is government order.  If not I will need to hire a graphic artist to do so -- I presume you do not have the capability to fix this art?  Please reply ASAP!!!!_x000D_

I hope you are doing great.   It has been a few years, I am not sure if you remember me, but I used to work at Evans.   After knowing the AAkron family since the mid 90’s, I joined the company a few years ago.  I attached my contact information for your records:_x000D_

Looks like I am not the only one with changes, when did Logogram join the Proforma family?    When I was in your office, you were part of AIA._x000D_

If there is anything that either myself or Michelle can do, please let us know.   Look forward to working with you again._x000D_

I hope you are getting things are getting back to normalcy after Irma.  My family felt so bad for you all were facing because of the storm and we were glued to the TV because my parents live outside Tampa,  an Uncle in Naples and my cousin lives in the Keys._x000D_
_x000D_
The day the storm hit, the Halcyon bottles were delivered to your office.   I have not heard anything from the group but with Irma, I would have expected as much.   Did you in fact receive the samples and was everyone happy with the final product?_x000D_
_x000D_
Let us know if you did receive them, if not, we could work with UPS to track them down._x000D_

Good morning Jill ~_x000D_
_x000D_
I do have a couple questions so we can quote this correctly for you  . Did you happen to have a sample of this box ?_x000D_
Our vendor is asking if you want this just to be printed with High gloss chipboard on just 1 side .  The website shows high gloss and a laminate . If I send this to be laminated they would do both sides and will add quite a bit to price ._x000D_
Will the design wrap all the way around the box (Even on the bottom )_x000D_
Then last To open the box it almost looks like it would open on the back side or bottom. Do you have a preference ?_x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you,_x000D_

I think she was hoping for a full color imprint on the box.  There are several companies offering the full color packaging now.  This is for a university and she would have her creative team create the design based on a template.  She would likely order about 1200 pieces.  I have attached a picture of the coffee mug box Hit offers so you can see what my customer is looking for._x000D_

I have a client that wants to give something unique to the members of a running club for grades 1-12.  They need 15,000 pieces with an in hands date of 4.27.15.  Their price point is $0.50 - $1.00.  They want to stay as close to $0.50 as possible.  Would you price me on the 71117 Mood Cup and 67520 Mood Cycle Bottle?  Please price a one color imprint on both sides and a full color imprint on both sides.  I have attached their logo’s.  One would go on one side of the cup/bottle and the URL would go on the other.  I am open to any suggestions as well._x000D_

I rec'd your PO and am entering it now...just want to verify the qty because in the color breakdown says: 500 yellow w/ Tire Kingdom; 1,000 white w/ Merchants; 7,500 yellow w/ NTB; 1,500 red w/ BigO - adds up to 10,500pcs. Also, I thought when we originally talked, that the imprint color was going to be the same on all - I see that you have imprint colors of black, red & blue- that is 2 copy changes with charge of $20/ea net.

 

Also, does your destination have a dock to receive palletized shipments? I have done an Estes trucking est to zip 33408 apx: $390 (with a dock); if there is no dock, lift gate and inside delivery charges will apply - est $545.

 

If you ship UPS Hundred weight, it is apx: $455 - individual boxes (20 @ 42lbs <mailto:20@42lbs>  ea)

 

Please advise, thank you.

Hi Richard.  I hope you’re doing well today!  We are adding about 25 new national sales people this year and I am updating our preferred vendor list for them.  Is it possible to get EQP for 2018 so I can add your company’s information to this list?  We are expecting our sales to increase drastically but the new people will be using the vendors from this list._x000D_

Hey Carrie,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Morgan has made a carrier move and went back into the medical field.  She did tell me about the price changes.  I try extremely hard to work with the companies that work with us and Aakron has always did a great job.  The years we did the most was the first few years of the cup that changed colors.    Since I have decided to not hire anyone to replace Morgan, I  will be the person that will guide our customers to products to fulfill their promotional needs.  Aakron was an easy sale for me, but I admit I turned a lot of the walk in sales over to Morgan and did not monitor our order flow to Aakron.  I plan to review your catalog and see what products are available.  If I think I can make your quota, I will discuss this with you or my multiline rep to see if we can get back on the EQP program.  I can assure you that  if I obligate myself,  it would not be a problem to meet the sales.  Can you please update me on what our  total sales where for the past quote time.  Looks like the sales need to be in the $6000.00 range.  Catch me up to date and we will move forward from there. If possible please put me on the e mail special. I plan to continue to use Morgan’s email until I can get with my IT guy,  to tell me how to combine it with a new common e mail.  Thanks._x000D_

Hi Morgan, just wanted to follow up with an email from your discussion with Miranda earlier this month. We have discontinued your EQP program due to not meeting the goal of $5-6,000 by the month of June 2012._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
If you have any programs you'd like us to provide pricing for a few items, please let us know. Always take advantage of items on sales flyer and closeouts (while supplies last):_x000D_

_x000D_
Good Morning Brittany ~ 2017 will be a special year for the AAkron family; AAkron Line is turning 50 years old.  We have come a long way from the two-car garage that was our first production and office space.   We would not have grown to the company we are today without the support of our customers like you._x000D_
_x000D_
AAkron Line is pleased to announce that National Bank Products has qualified for our 2017 EQP Pricing Program.    This program recognizes and rewards our top clients for their continued partnership and support._x000D_
_x000D_
Attached are the program details & requirements for your records. The annual sales volume requirements for this program are $10,000.   To help ensure that we exceed this requirement for 2017, we can help with marketing support, program suggestions and much more.  Just let us know how we can help._x000D_
_x000D_
New for 2017, we added over 50 new products and we expanded the AAkron exclusive items to over 125 items.  AAkron is also trailblazing new printing techniques with the introduction of our Full Color Direct printing.  FCD Direct printing offers full color decorating on a growing list of drinkware items on either 1/side, 2/side or a full wrap full color printing for about the same price as 1/c imprinting and for the same set up charge.

We know that Canada and USA springboards are different.  And I do update them separately. But sometimes a item is missed. But I always try to check random items on both sides.  Our pricing is good from Jan to Dec of every year._x000D_

Hi Amanda,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
You are correct springboard was updated at the beginning of the year on the US side with the .96 and .90 net pricing but I do not show an entry made this year on the Canadian side.   The last entry made for Canada was on 2/7/12 with a start date for the new pricing to begin on 5/16/12._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
The springboard systems are separate so when an item is updated in the US we do not see those updates in Canada.  So if we carry the item in both US and Canada, it has to be updated for each system._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
We currently have this pen in our Canada summer catalog which is in circulation from 6/14 to 9/15 so would appreciate if the current net price could be honored until we can update our sell price when this book expires._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Can you honor until our summer book expires?_x000D_

Your correct price should be 200min @ $ .96/ea. And 500 or more @ $ .90/ea.. When was the last update on this item? I am guess that this was last years pricing?_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
If you look on the USA side the pricing is $ .96/ea. Net and $ .90/ea. Net. With a $36.00 net set up._x000D_
_x000D_

Hi Amanda and Ann Marie,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I see that an entry for increase was entered on the above pen and wondered if you could please change the date to 9/16 for this increase to take effect?_x000D_

We currently have the 55100 in our summer catalog and that catalog will expire on 9/15.  After this catalog expires, we will have the opportunity to also adjust our sell price._x000D_

Hello_x000D_
_x000D_
Based on the pricing online line the .384 is the Regular net and the .79 and .64 pricing are your Regular Retail Pricing we would need the closeout pricing to be around .29 net to show a discount._x000D_
_x000D_
The color entered is Cherry Red Cup with Black Trim, this color is not showing up on the website so we would need the hi-res image show the color you are offering._x000D_

I believe we are all set. I set this to Ann Marie and I think we are good. The only thing that I haven’t heard anything back on is if we wanted to pick up any of the styles ourselves._x000D_
_x000D_
So I will double check on that and let you know._x000D_

Regarding the reason behind dropping exclusivity --- aside from the versions that aren’t selling well, it’s about not being quite as effective after such a length of time. If it’s been exclusive for 3 years, the marketability really dies down. Does that make sense?_x000D_

Since we have the die cut here already made we would not have to order another one. That min. is just in the beginning._x000D_

The only min. qty. you would have would be the 500pcs to place a order._x000D_

Also talked to Ann Marie she said she would talk to Danielle about wanting to take any of your styles. But was wondering why you would be considering not to have these styles exclusively? Are you still marketing these pencils anywhere?_x000D_

3 out of the 4 styles are selling pretty good…_x000D_

Good afternoon Amanda,

We actually just took on the Donate Life account earlier this year.  Right now we are just getting things setup for their store we are doing for them.  They are still looking at very basic items to stock for now.    As we move forward I will definitely contact you regarding items you have in their color!  

 

Thank You,

Hey Jen, 

 

Thanks for the spec sample order. We will get this moving asap. Carrie is processing this for you. I noticed the customer is Donate Life. We have done many custom items for this program in the past and have seen the business lost by some distributors and picked with others. I believe they were switching up their preferred vendor last year.

 

I’d be happy to provide some ideas and items we stock specifically in their colors.

 

Do you have any upcoming projects? If so we can work on some virtual as well!?

 

Thanks, Amanda

Thank you for the email and confirmation._x000D_
_x000D_
I am happy that you agree, the product was not defective, they were just not happy with the item color.     Because of our commitment to our partnership, I would like to revise my offer where we split the order 50/50.   I do not want you to absorb the entire cost of the order and I do not think that AAkron should either._x000D_
_x000D_
You guys did not nothing wrong and neither did AAkron._x000D_
_x000D_
Does this revised offer sound fair?_x000D_

Hi Mike,_x000D_
_x000D_
Wanted to follow-up on the resolution for this.  I rec’d your samples and the customer’s order.  I see no issues with what they received.  However, the customer isn’t happy and returned all of the product to us.  As this is a bigger relationship than just this order we will be honoring a Full credit to accommodate them in this situation._x000D_
_x000D_
We would like to accept the 25% discount you offered to help us have less of a loss.  Can you please process a Credit Memo for that?_x000D_
_x000D_
Let me know how to proceed._x000D_
_x000D_
Thanks,_x000D_

The customer is disappointed and isn’t willing to keep the order.  We’ve asked her to return the product back to my attention here so I can check it out.  In the meantime, can you send me a few samples of that item in Green so I can compare and see her concerns?_x000D_
_x000D_
This is a really good customer of ours so we have to take care of this with a full credit.  Based on our partnership, I’m hoping you can help us with a credit as well considering this is an isolated situation._x000D_

I’ll let you know how they are as soon as I get them back._x000D_

I am not sure what we could have done as a company to prevent this from happening:  our image is an accurate portrayal of the item color and the item does function.   Do you agree?_x000D_
_x000D_
With that being said and in light of our long standing partnership, we would be willing to offer a 25% discount off the item and set up charges.  Would this help your customer keep the order?_x000D_

I completely understand, Mike, and was shocked to hear her issues for sure. Again, she orders frequently and I don't get complaints unless there is a real issue._x000D_
_x000D_
She claims both. I apologize for the description, but she says the green is a ""puke"" color and the items are only very slightly color changing._x000D_

This is one of top selling items and to my knowledge we have not had any issues with the product not functioning properly or not changing colors.   If the product is defective, then we want to isolate this problem and get it corrected immediately._x000D_
_x000D_
If the problem is the color of the unit, I am not sure how we misrepresented the color or delivered something she was not expecting._x000D_
_x000D_
As you know, once the item is printed, there is no return value so we are out the cost of the item, the printing and labor involved.    If the item is defective, we are going to stand behind the product._x000D_
_x000D_
I am confused on what has true issue your client has with the product:  item color or is it not changing colors?_x000D_
_x000D_
Please let us know so we can correct this in an efficient manner._x000D_

I apologize for this issue. This is a very long term customer and I’ve only had a couple of product issues with her over the years and they have always been legitimate.  She knows to get product samples ahead of time for exact color matches, but that wasn’t a need on this product. She is really stressing her unhappiness with the color and “function” of the mood change._x000D_
_x000D_
They have had these for several days now.  I did advise about the color shocking remedy and her response is below.  If possible, I would appreciate if she could return._x000D_
_x000D_
Yes, I did that. It is changing a little but it is not noticeable at all._x000D_

I am sorry to hear that you customer is not happy with his item._x000D_
_x000D_
Item Color_x000D_
That is our standard green item color.  Here is a picture from our website which I would assume is the same as what it shown on your website_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Is this not the color your customer received?_x000D_
_x000D_
Color Changing_x000D_
This item does change colors. It was go from a green to a yellow.   Because the material is thick, the color change is not instantaneous but it will change.    Since the item does change colors with heat, if the temperature of the item gets warm if it is left in a heat of a car for example, it will change colors.   But when you bring it into an air conditioned room, the color will change back to the green color above.   Did your customer give the item a moment to see the item change colors?   Did the item already change colors because it was in the heat when they tested the item._x000D_

I have include Michelle Finnigan on this email chain as well.  Please reply to all when you reply._x000D_

Hello,_x000D_
_x000D_
The client for this order has received this order and is unhappy with the product.  The color is not as she expected. I have attached a picture for reference, but the client insists the picture does not do it justice in person. She describes it as a ""puke"" green and that they are not color changing. She wants to return. Please let me know what options we have with this._x000D_

_x000D_
Hope you’re doing well today. I have a favor to ask. I have a small order for the Fun Pro crayons—288 units. I know we normally get EQP at 2nd column, but is there any way I might be able to for this order as well? Thank you for your support!_x000D_

Hello Amanda,_x000D_

_x000D_
I am the new Web Content Coordinator for Leaderpromos.com and I will be managing the catalogs within our office._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I was wondering if we could get 50 of your 2013 catalogs, if they have not already been ordered._x000D_
_x000D_
I was also told to make sure you know that we cannot pay for shipping costs on the catalogs, if that is an issue or if you are not the correct person to contact, please let me know._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_

   Hi Tony,_x000D_
_x000D_

_x000D_
   We could use your help! We are just about at our wit’s end with Aakron’s art department in regards to the full color bookmarks we have been ordering. The first time we ever sent the art (earlier this year), we used the dimensions listed on the website. They came back to us and said our dimensions were incorrect. We requested a template for the product, which we received and used to resubmit the art. After that, whenever we have had an order, we have used that same template. On EVERY SINGLE order we have placed, we have gotten calls from Miranda saying the art is not the correct size._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
   Because the front side of the bookmark looks the same on most of our orders, Miranda wants to set it up as stock art and use it as a reorder; however, there is a subtle change in that art on some of the orders. A national hotline number that has been integrated into the art is sometimes changed to a client’s local number. Because the art varies on both the front and back, even when it looks similar, I prefer to send new art each time to make sure we don’t mess up on a reorder._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
   Yesterday, we received yet another call about these bookmarks. Amanda, my art assistant, asked Miranda to send us the template she would prefer us to use. She received back the EXACT template that we received before. When she pointed this out, Miranda then sent the “correct” specs, which differ by only a few hundredths to even a few thousandths of an inch, and apparently are only “approximate!” (I included their email exchange below)._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
   We don’t have any problems with Aakron’s art department on any other product, so it’s baffling to me that this one item can be such a hassle. Because it is happening on every order we place, and this has become a popular product for us, we are seriously considering choosing another vendor to do our bookmark orders. The amount of time wasted going back and forth with Aakron every time we order is ridiculous. Do you have any ideas of how this can be remedied?_x000D_
_x000D_

   Here are the measurements provided by the art department:_x000D_
_x000D_
   “ the measurements are roughly: Imprint area-1.629x5.7, cut line 1.869x6 and Bleed Line-2.129x6.258”_x000D_
_x000D_
   They still recommend supplying the last PO where this was used so we can set it up as stock art.  Thank you._x000D_

   I left you a voicemail a few minutes ago. It looks like I built our internal template from this file previously and all of the sizes match._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
   Imprint Area/Safe Area: 1.625 x 5.75” (rounded)_x000D_
_x000D_
   Cut Line: 1.875 x 6” (rounded)_x000D_

   Bleed Line: 2.125 x 6.25” (rounded)_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
   The Aakron website conflicts with these sizes as stating:_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
   Imprint Area: Art intended to print to the edge must extend to 2"" W x 6-1/4"" H. Art not intended to print to the edge must be within 1-1/2"" W x 5-3/4"" H_x000D_

Good morning Amanda,_x000D_

I think there’s a “Stacy/Stacey” confusion. Stacy Cope is our vendor relations/customer service specialist who you work with on a more regular basis, regarding specific orders usually. I work in Marketing and handle the catalog production, including new product introductions, deletions, etc. Sorry for the confusion. Anyhow, in a round-a-bout way, I did receive the red box with new product introductions?. There are a couple of products that we’re considering for next year, but the decisions won’t be made for sure until mid-December. If there’s anything else in particular that you’d like us to consider, please let me know. Thanks so much!_x000D_

The event is the end of April.  If they could ship in mid April that would be fine.

		Hi Rebecca,
		Sorry I didn't get back to you at the end of the day; would you like the whole order to be blue then? We can do half blue/half green if you'd like.
		Also, having a larger imprint (apx 8x8 - as long as it doesn't inflict with sides/seams) is something we could look into, but costs for the transfers at a larger size would be more; and I'd have to meet with my supervisor/owners on the costs.
		 
		Let me know how you would like to proceed, thanks

	Carrie,
	 
	Thank you for sending out the proof.  The  client wanted to see if they could change the logo to accomodate the bag shape better.  The oval on the bag was 8"" in W
	Would they have a 8""  x 8"" area to work with ?

			Hi Rebecca, 
			 
			I just wanted to advise you that your prod proof will be prepared for delivery (overnight) on 3/17; arriving 3/18.
			 
			The factory we outsource our full color printing materials was late sending out the materials because they weren't sure how the transfer would go on the striped bag (lamination); we informed them that we've done it before and they shipped out yesterday.
			 
			I apologize for the delay, I know your inhands date is 4/7/10, and we have some time, but let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

				HI Rebecca,
				 
				Just wanted to advise you that there is a $28/net prod proof charge.
				We outsource our FCD printing materials and need to cover costs for small amounts of materials ordered for prod proofs; when you approve the proof, the $28/net will be removed, if the art is changed, than the proof charge will apply.

I have received your email confirmation for the meeting on Friday, September 21st at 10am. Yes, we are still on. The Merchandising Department consists of myself and a Merchandising Assistant, but we have invited a few other key players to the meeting. So, I am thinking between 5-8 will be in attendance. Kim is no longer with the company, I am taking over Vendor Relations for Pinnacle. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!_x000D_

_x000D_
_x000D_
   I'm sorry, we really don't have the time in our schedule that week for a full team meeting. If Carrie wanted to, I'd be happy to set a time Friday afternoon for her to meet with me and my merchandising team. Would that work? If not, maybe we can set up a time for a full meeting at the end of this year or beginning of next?_x000D_

   Hey Kim, I wanted to touch base about scheduling a meeting with the team next time we are in town. I am expecting a lil one myself so Carrie, my inside rep will be making an ATL trip for me in Sept. I was hoping to schedule a meeting for Carrie to meet with your team to go over our new and debuting Holiday Catalog along with some other specials and new products we are adding for the fall._x000D_

Hi Amanda and Carrie,

 

Hope all is well.

 

Just reaching out to introduce myself as the new Director of Inside Sales for Pinnacle Promotions.  I joined the Pinnacle team back in March, needed a little ramp time, and am now fully engaged so please feel free to reach out if anything comes up.  Matt Fishbein is no longer with Pinnacle so please direct any correspondence related to my department directly to me.  

 

I look forward to working with you!

 

 

Sincerely,

	I am working with Danielle and Amanda Harrington to be sure that a 2-color imprint could work on this…will advise if capable. 

	 

	Furthermore, there are essentially 5 PMS matches @ $28/net and we'll waive the change of in fees (if one-color imprint). 


	We'd like to advise that the color changing or ""hidden"" imprint may not always be hidden depending on temperature of room. 

	 

	Will touch base with you shortly after we speak with Danielle on production/2-color imprint…but may need to be a one-color imprint.

		Are you looking for the 20550 - black eraser or 20551 matching color eraser?

		Also please specify which color pencil you'd like to see this on.

		This will require a PMS match for the imprint color which we will waive for a one-time spec.

hI THERE,
What if I put the p.o. in to you for the pens.  What happens with cancellation?  I really don't want to take the chance to lose them.
Also.. if we take all the stock, can we have the lower price?  We'd still be a little short... but I feel it would be a good service to the client. 
 
Thanks.

	Lori,
	 
	I have attached a revised quote - changing the Scrapper (item#40054) price to .35 and red stock for 10M is OK.
	 
	Also, I have added the non-woven tote (item#59010) for both RED & WHITE. We only have apx.= 5M RED bags avail. at this time, however, we do have 10M WHITE avail now. You may do all white, or choose to do a split of the two colors. If you choose another color in the bags, we will waive the change of ink fee. 
	 
	The weight on the woven bags is 80grams.
	 
	Lastly, the only way to hold the stock for the requested items, I would need a purchase order. By entering these items, they are saved for you; we can leave the PO open for any changes/additions/updates. 
	 
	Please let me know if you have any questions.
	 
	Thanks,
	Carrie

_x000D_
As we head into the holiday season, the management team at Quality Logo Products is ready to begin another prosperous year with our valued suppliers (that’s you)!_x000D_
_x000D_
It’s that time of year when we review our agreements and strategy with you – what’s been going well, what could be improved, and where we go from here.  We’ve grown tremendously with some suppliers this year, but have tremendous room for improvement with others.  If we could increase communication and sales numbers with all of our suppliers that would be... well… tremendous!_x000D_
_x000D_
We would like to kick off our 2017 plan together by requesting two things:_x000D_
_x000D_
1       Provide 2017 pricing in Excel format – coded pricing for every product at every quantity (see attached example) – as soon as possible.  Please, no PDFs or URLs to digital catalogs.  If pricing is submitted in the attached format, it will reduce errors on our website and on our POs to you – which means less work and fewer clarifications for everyone going forward!  Your help with getting pricing in this format is immensely appreciated.  Should you need us to sign any NDAs with respect to pricing, just let us know!_x000D_
_x000D_
2       Complete and return your 2017 Operational Agreement with QLP.  The attached Excel document is the blueprint to our success with your company; it is the most important (and confidential) document that we will work on together in 2017. We welcome any questions or comments about its contents.  Please note that any red fields require a response (including your approval at the top).  You will also see candid feedback from the QLP team at the bottom that we hope you will find beneficial._x000D_
_x000D_
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!  While there is no set time frame to send back everything, I respectfully ask that all documents be returned no later than 12/1/16._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you again for your partnership in 2016 and beyond.  We appreciate all of the hard work and dedication from you and your team. Good suppliers are the foundation of our business, and QLP would not be where it is today without you!_x000D_

Hi!_x000D_
_x000D_
I was so pleasantly caught-off guard that you were there and love meeting you!!!  Have you gone before?  I came back by but you were away from the booth.  I thought it was a different kind of show this year.  Most folks still out-standing but some down right rude to people.  Perhaps burn-out with Vegas and Orlando back to back, but was still odd._x000D_
_x000D_
I will let you know about the tracker.  And I did see the space was teeny tiny and appreciate your pointing that out to me.  Will evaluate what tweaks I might make to my current logo keeping that in mind.  The only time I get frustrated, logo wise and print, is when a very similar item with perhaps even less space is able to use my logo and other times not.  At least I have you, one contact person.  There is another place where sometimes my old logo would get bounced and other times not._x000D_
_x000D_
As you were so nice to offer, go ahead and have a virtual done when you have a moment.  Let's see what they come up with and I will think also.  I definitely understand that sometimes it will have to change.  Pesky logo._x000D_
_x000D_
I may get a sample too and definitely will prior to ordering.  I got one year ago, not from a Supplier, and it did not work at all well for me.  Sleep was way off and that was one of the reasons I had gotten it for sleeping is a real challenge for me.  It aslo registered my hands typing on my keyboard as steps.  Man, based on how much I supposedly went, well I should have been a real skinny thing._x000D_
_x000D_
Mike did get back with me.  And I am thrilled it will still be you and he, I am sure the other person is nice too, but still....It's hard one gets to know and work with reps, often times sticks with the company based on that relationship and then they are promoted or move to another territory._x000D_
_x000D_
Thanks again for your help._x000D_

Hello Susan ,_x000D_
_x000D_
I have the sample order entered in ,so this will be going out today and I will send tracking as soon as I have it ._x000D_
It was great meeting you in Orlando , I loved getting to see all these people I talk to on a daily basis . You all are like my home away from home , so to put a face to the name  is fantastic !!!_x000D_
By now I am sure Mike has gotten back to you . He will be handling Aim Accounts as well ,  So instead of just having one Sales Rep you now have Two !  Pretty great odds  ._x000D_
AS far as a Personal Sales Aid goes the PSA price is $ 10.08 net with a $ 20.00 set up for a 1 color imprint. The minimum is the 20 pcs  . Just keep in mind there is not a lot of imprint room on this item and it is an uneven surface so small print does not do well  .  If you would like me to set up a virtual for you just say the word ._x000D_

Thank you,_x000D_

Hello Bob ,_x000D_
_x000D_
We actually have already set up the special pricing for Kona at the absolute lowest we are able to go . Last week shaving the price down a little more than was previously quoted ._x000D_
 Your current net price on the 17 oz mood cup is $ .34 with a $ 28.00 set up (Waived on exact repeats) as quoted . We will honor this price for Kona regardless what quantity is ordered  because the program was so successful this last year  ._x000D_
_x000D_
I also wanted to get back to you in regard to the sleeve that we had been discussing for the hot beverages on Friday . This item is currently being looked at for cool beverages and we are not certain if we will be introducing it as part of the Aakron line . It is just an item we are looking at as a possibility . I am told it would be able to be converted however to a hot beverage sleeve if Kona was interested in that route rather than a cup for hot beverages ._x000D_

This past year we've spoke on numerous occasions about getting Kona Ice to place a blanket order for their Mood Cup program, moving forward into 2015. Our last order for 15,000 on Regency PO #60163, dated Oct 2014 capped out the introductory year at 290,000 Mood Cups on the program._x000D_
Can you quote me on a blanket order for quantities breaks from 200,000 to 300,000 cups for 2015?_x000D_

I am so sorry this happened !_x000D_
Bob had told me that periodically a box might go out 1 or 2 cups short and that is with in the realm of possibility as we are all human , however  as I told Bob,  as a  rule we ship extras out  .  I will enter a new order for the 75 pcs and We will definitely do our best to be sure that we send out  the replacement cups today to Richard Weaver  ._x000D_
_x000D_
I did just speak with the plant manager as well to see what may have changed in our process that this might happen . I am not sure you are aware ,but we did just recently put on a second shift and so we have a lot of new people working for us in TN . He believes that one of the new hires packaging miscounted  , and will be speaking with all employees that worked on this order  ._x000D_

I will send the tracking when it comes available ._x000D_

Hi everyone,_x000D_
_x000D_
I just received the below email this morning. Unfortunately, this is only one of a handful of cases that I've heard about being short in the past week or so, and it's causing Regency to have to give these folks credits on their orders._x000D_
_x000D_
With this one, because it is a substantial amount (15%) of the box, can you send him some replacement cups? With them being custom cups, I feel bad that they paid as much as they did, only to come up short._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you!_x000D_

Hi Steve_x000D_
I just opened the second case of color changing cups on this order and it is short by 75.  Appears that mostly the yellow cups are missing.  I’m not a stickler. If you can make up the difference in unprinted cups that would be fine with me and color is not an issue._x000D_

I went in and started poking around at what happened with this order, as we were all told that you should have received yesterday, worst case scenario._x000D_
_x000D_
Well, apparently not. I got in touch with the manufacturer just now, and they have your cups finished and are overnighting them to you...meaning you will have tomorrow. My apologies for this delay, the factory has been having trouble keeping up with the Kona demand this year, as you are are probably well aware._x000D_

Good afternoon Gentlemen ,_x000D_

I am just following up on my phone calls  to Shawn and Robert  in regard to  the 17 Ounce Mood stadium cups that we have produced for the Kona Ice Inventory Program  the past few years .  I just wanted to check in to see if Kona would be proceeding with this item again this year ._x000D_
As you recall from previous years the sooner we receive an order, and the sooner I can ship ,the better the pricing I can offer you ._x000D_
_x000D_
Please advise at your earliest convenience if you will be requiring a quotation for 2018 on the 17 ounce  mood stadium cups ._x000D_

Hello Ryan ,_x000D_
_x000D_
WE have a couple options I wanted to give you in cups to start._x000D_
WE have the Mood stadium cup which changes color with ice cold liquids , the Sun Fun Stadium cup which turns color in direct sun light and then the standard stadium cups . These options are available in both the 17 ounce and 22 ounce and also the  sports bottles ._x000D_
Our  spot color option  is available on 1 or 2 sides  . WE are able to provide a second color on 1 side only and registration will vary 1/8” in any direction making close registration impossible ._x000D_
The 17 ounce Stadium cups can be imprinted with FCD  , but we do require heat transfers as I mentioned. We may be able to get these in 2 days and ship with in 4  ,but as I mentioned I wouldn’t know until the morning . ( Normally heat transfers take 4 full days to receive in)._x000D_
The sports bottles we would be able to print direct on. These I could have in 24-48  hours if we have ready to go art and we do not need an eproof ._x000D_

I just received an order for 63 cases of pencils, is it too late to add these to the order?  They can come later than the other ones if it will slow down the original order._x000D_

Is there some way you can give me and idea of pricing for 2011, we need this so we can figure our sell for 2011._x000D_
_x000D_

I know on the CAT RACING co-op you were able to quote us for 2011.  Is it because this is a carpenters pencil?_x000D_

Hi Jason,_x000D_
_x000D_
Could I ask you for a favor? Would you mind sending this to the reps that attended my meeting yesterday? I didn’t have a chance to collect business cards._x000D_
_x000D_
Hi Scarborough Specialties,_x000D_
_x000D_
It was a pleasure meeting you all yesterday. I just wanted to say thank you again for taking time out of your busy day to meet with me and learn a little more about AAkron Line and all of our capabilities. I have CC’d your dedicated inside sales rep Tatum Schafer, she and I are both here to assist you with any needs. As part of Facilis you also have Mike Zingale and Michelle Finnigan as part of the team. I hope that you were able to see a few new things and some ideas were able to spark for future or current projects._x000D_
_x000D_
Just a friendly reminder: All samples are free (all we ask for is a shipper number), virtuals are free and all specs – please email directly to me and CC’ Tatum. Also please do not forget to take advantage of our Free 3 day at ground service and our YOU First Program.  I’ve also added our AAkron benefits sheet which gives you more details about AAkron and Facilis._x000D_
_x000D_
Looking forward to working together!_x000D_
_x000D_
Best,_x000D_

Hello Denise ,_x000D_
_x000D_
I have included 2015 pricing on this email . I wasn’t sure how to fill your spreadsheet out as I gave you 2 price points depending on what the client is purchasing .  Hopefully this will not mess you up too much ?  Did you want me to send this to Michelle as well ?_x000D_
We are pleased to announce pricing for 2015 and  Signete has  qualified for the EQP Program, which starts at first quantity break!   Attached is a copy of the program for your records .  A sales volume of $ 10,000.00 annually is required to maintain this program.  All pricing is Net, F.O.B. Factory, Net 30 days.  Pricing will be effective January 1, and will be effective through December 31, 2015.  For any additional charges, catalog pricing will prevail._x000D_
_x000D_
We are continuing our ""You First"" Shipping Program which offers FREE 24 Hour Rush Service on eligible products.   You’ll also notice we have expanded our Mood Drinkware line to include new styles and many new colors to the existing styles!_x000D_

Hello Pam ,_x000D_
_x000D_
I hope you had a nice weekend , it’s been so cold this past month that I personally can not wait for Spring ! I have had our art department make a few flyers up for you based off some stock designs . Breast Cancer Awareness, Made in the USA ,Sun Fun and Mood are all popular flyers we send out . Then the Specials which will be good through April .  I had to break these files up into 2 emails as the files are rather large . Let me know if you do not receive all 7 flyers . (The specials has 3 flyers on 1 PDF .)_x000D_
Hopefully one or all of these will come in handy for you ._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you,_x000D_

I can imagine !  Do you send mass emailings ? If you want to send the art for your logo , I will send some flyers your way if you think you could  work with that . Our specials we can send out also , some prices  are EQP or better and are customer friendly ._x000D_
My better half Mike Zingale is the ideas master , I will see if he can come up with anything else ._x000D_

Well I’m happy to hear from you  and So sorry to hear you were under the weather , I know how that goes . Hopefully  all is well now ._x000D_
I did notice a trend that you were slow at the beginning of the year the past couple years , but I wanted to be sure nothing happened I was unaware of ,  just in case .   If we can help you with flyers to send out with your Logo let us know .  I attached  a link to different flyers we have like Breast Cancer awareness and Fire prevention . Not sure what your main target group  is…_x000D_

Hey Michelle!!!!!!!_x000D_
Thanks for your e-mail._x000D_
Historically (we have been in business 22 years) Dec – Feb are our slowest months.  We have definitely kicked off our FB page with lots of marketing, but so far it has not done a thing.  Have just signed up for CONSTANT CONTACT to get some additional help – and we are working on some general marketing online videos… we are providing a company store for one of our largest accounts, so we plan to use LOTS of Aakron merchandise._x000D_
_x000D_
I was also under the weather a good bit last month – and so was my help – at different times… so we hit a slow spot, but hang tight.  We are working on some new marketing and there is stuff going on…  we are learning as we go._x000D_
Thanks again for contacting me!!!_x000D_

Good afternoon Pam ,_x000D_
_x000D_
I just wanted to check in and see how you have been . This year came in like a lion and I finally had a little slow down to check in on some of my favorite customers . You had worked so hard to build up your account last year and I was so excited to give you EQP this year ,but We haven’t seen much come over from you lately  and I just wanted to see if there was anything that we had done wrong  that I was not aware of , or if it is just a slow start to the year ._x000D_
When you have a minute I would enjoy hearing back from you and if you would like to continue the monthly specials ._x000D_

On top of the monthly special program we have been discussing  which is attached we are going to start Southern Sales and Marketing on our EQP program for 2015 which  starts at first quantity break!

Pricing will be effective January 1, and will be effective through December 31, 2015.  Some exclusions do apply such as Maglites and Paper products . I have also attached a EQP Price list for 2015 that lists all the items in the program and there FOB point .  For any additional charges, catalog pricing will prevail._x000D_
I have attached Mike Zingale (your outside sales rep) and my business card . If either of us can help you out please feel free to reach out ! We are here to support you and we are confident with the right support and partnership, we are going to be able to exceed this requirement ._x000D_

Hello Pam ,_x000D_
_x000D_
I thought about the opportunity you offered last week for a weekly program and I ran it by my supervisor . We decided it would be easier to offer the items for a full month on our end . In the past we have found that 1 week is not long enough because people finally here about the program and it is over ._x000D_
So our thought was we will offer 2 items during the month and you can offer them at separate time or the same time and see what happens .  WE will review how it goes at the end of the year and see what happens ._x000D_
Sound like a plan ?_x000D_
I have attached a quote for what we are able to do until the end of the year ._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you,_x000D_

Hi Candice, we have an order in-house that we used to work with Gina on. The program is the NSP/National Safe Place co-op with special PO’s and instructions. Would you be the contact for this program? I want to update the co-op to reflect the most recent POC’s. Thanks!

Hey Carrie,_x000D_
_x000D_
I am in the process of setting up a new client with a program similar to the one we do for Sky Zone and they are interested in a few of your items. I wanted to see what kind of program pricing we might be able to do on the following items:_x000D_
_x000D_
      1)      #71117 – 17oz Mood Stadium Cup_x000D_
      2)      #45920 – 9” Value Flyer_x000D_
      3)      #20551 – Mood Pencil w/ Colored eraser_x000D_
_x000D_
I am pretty sure we would always be ordering quantities of 1,000, but can you send me pricing at both 500 and 1,000? Client name is Get Air…_x000D_

Thanks!!_x000D_

Hey Miranda,

 

Hope you are having a great day! I wanted to check in with you and see if we can receive EQP pricing across the board since we have increased our orders with you and we have a lot more to come for this year.

 

Here are the numbers we are looking at so far:

Last year we did  less than 2,000 in sales with your company

This year we have done $14,000 to date and we still have two more months to go. 

 

 

 

Please let me know.

Thanks

Can you check on the file for this order or our company. The salesperson Tammy Angelo is thinking that we received a quote for the HMA program on these.

I am a factory representative for AAkron, so I only have the AAkron product line.  Yes, TSC does have EQP pricing on the AAkron line for 2015.   I did see that we did send an email the end of December, but I will make sure that we update it to come directly to you._x000D_
_x000D_
I have also included the contact information for Michelle Finnigan who manages the SE Region Inside Sales efforts.  Michelle is my right arm back at the factory.   You already know me so you will agree that she is the better half of Team M&M ?    I attached her contact information for your records:_x000D_

If you or anyone on the team has any questions, never hesitate to contact either myself or Michelle and we would be more than happy to help out._x000D_

_x000D_
Thanks for your voicemail and for the information!_x000D_
_x000D_
Michelle – Below are some answers to the questions at hand._x000D_
_x000D_
I have already informed the client that it is recommended that for this very rare order, that we do a one color imprint. This is not something that will happen a lot. This is an order that may come across next year when they end their next fiscal year, but not by any means a regular basis. I am not so worried for the future since we will have already placed other orders with these logos and therefore will have paid for the setups at some point. My only concern right now, is with this order._x000D_
_x000D_
Please let me know if there is anything you can do to facilitate this rare request. Thanks!_x000D_

Hi Ladies!_x000D_
_x000D_
I have a unique POS order situation I would like to discuss with you. The manager of National Accounts On Premise is given a very small budget for POS – and therefore has a difficult time meeting any of the minimum order QTY’s on the DeutschStore for just one brand. Are we able to meet the order minimums across multiple brands for this case?_x000D_
_x000D_
They would like to order the following:_x000D_
_x000D_
50 of the 17 oz. Halcyon Bottles TOTAL_x000D_
5 of them with the Barone Fini Logo_x000D_
5 of them with the Crossings logo_x000D_
5 of them with the Girard Logo_x000D_
4 of them with the Carr Logo_x000D_
4 of them with the Josh Logo_x000D_
5 of them with the Kunde Logo_x000D_
17 of them with the Redemption Logo_x000D_
5 of them with the Calling Logo_x000D_
_x000D_
Is it possible to order this way? Is there ANY way to avoid the setup charges for each logo? Do you have a record of which logo’s we have done so far so that we can determine if setup charges will apply? Can we order these as specs? What is the solution here?_x000D_
_x000D_
Sincerely,_x000D_

These sheets are still being done the “old fashioned” way right now. Crystal, if you have new products sheets you can send them to Jeff Nelson and he will distribute them amongst the group that has offered to help out until the Quickbase training is complete. That training was supposed to have happened today, but was delayed because the trainer is snowed in. This should move fairly quickly and if you’d prefer to hang onto them until the new process is in place you could do that as well thanks._x000D_

I replied to you email yesterday that I would get the samples ordered which I did for both Kim and Mary.    I wanted to clarify what you would like for us to do.   I mentioned adding the Tri Made Logo to the flyer so it is branded for you both to use.   Did you want us to add the Wellstar logo to the flyer instead of the Tri Made Logo?_x000D_

Hi Amanda and Carrie,
 
Thank you for the call!  I haven't had a chance to pick out any items yet.  Do you mind picking some of your favorites?  As you can see this logo is Holiday oriented so what ever items you think will work with this logo and could possibly be sold in a retail store.  Will you please also send pricing including minimums, setup charges and production times as well!  I really appreciate you contacting me and helping with this project!!!
 
Thank you!!!!!

Hey Carrie,
 
I have been traveling for a couple of days, and I have not had complete access to email until now (using my Blackberry, and no lap top!), so I have not been able to properly thank you for all of your research and the work you are doing to try and help me.  I thank you very much.  At some point we'll find something for my client....please feel free to continue the search.  If the wooden one is compliant, that may do just fine....so as soon as you find out on it, that may been the end of any more researching.
 
Thanks!
 
Carol :)

No, just regular plastic - it says PS Plastic which I believe is a thicker plastic. I know it's not the material you were looking for but it was a ""recycled"" option - image/shape.

Hi Carol,
We are still looking into the wooden sharpener to see if it is CPSIA compliant, attached is another sharpener, however, it is made of plastic but is in the form of a recycle bin...let us know if you'd like us to quote that.
 
The other sharpener (black image) is also at a 43M MOQ, I will check on unimprinted and see if the MOQ changes for the flower pot and this one.
 
Let me know if you are interested in the attached photo so we can get some pricing for you.
Thanks,
Carrie

Thanks!

Hi Carol,
 
We have a few options on the wooden and recycled pencil sharpeners you requested; Currently we received a wooden sharpener but I have attached photos of recycled sharpeners for you and your client to look at to see if you are interested in them before I provide you with pricing for all.
 
Let me know what you think!
Thanks,
Carrie

We were trying but we have decided to hold off for a little bit – I want to get settled in here and live in the city and enjoy that for a bit before we bring a baby into our world.  Probably next fall we’ll start trying again…it will be here before we know it!!_x000D_

I know what you mean…there was a few times yesterday that I looked around and was like ok what do I do now…I'm caught up so early in the day and then actually have time to be proactive! Less distractions and chit chat than office but hopefully I don't miss it too much :)_x000D_

I am going to work from home after maternity leave till at least end of the year and report into the office like one day a week to touch base and for new product meetings, etc. I leave like 5 mins from the office so it'll actually be a nice break from working from home._x000D_

I realized I hadn’t sent you anything and you are getting ready to go on maternity leave. J_x000D_

I am actually all settled in and working in Chicago – I got my office set up on Monday and started working on Tuesday.  So far, so good.  Will you be working permanently from your home office after the baby comes?_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
It still feels weird to be here and doesn’t feel real but it was a good decision to move back.  My hubby has started looking for a job and I’m getting into the routine of working from home.  I think I’ll get a lot more work done w/out all the chatting I do in the office. J_x000D_

        Hi Jamie,_x000D_
_x000D_
        I just wanted to touch base with you or Crystal, I assume you will be having a few people at the Vegas show in January. As Jackie has previously mentioned we'd be delighted to be able to take you out to dinner or lunch if you have time. We know you were not able to for the upcoming Dallas show, however if you have time in Vegas we'd love to be able to plan a dinner with you. We know the show can be busy and your calendar is probably already getting full : )_x000D_
_x000D_
        So if a few of you would be free either Tuesday or Thursday evening that week and would be interested in meeting a few of our reps or managers, please let me know and I will arrange that.  We value your business and are excited to work with you in the coming year. We hope were able to sit down and get you know you and your co-workers a little better._x000D_

        Hi Jamie,_x000D_
_x000D_
        I just wanted to touch base with you or Crystal, I assume you will be having a few people at the Vegas show in January. As Jackie has previously mentioned we'd be delighted to be able to take you out to dinner or lunch if you have time. We know you were not able to for the upcoming Dallas show, however if you have time in Vegas we'd love to be able to plan a dinner with you. We know the show can be busy and your calendar is probably already getting full : )_x000D_
_x000D_
        So if a few of you would be free either Tuesday or Thursday evening that week and would be interested in meeting a few of our reps or managers, please let me know and I will arrange that.  We value your business and are excited to work with you in the coming year. We hope were able to sit down and get you know you and your co-workers a little better._x000D_
_x000D_
        Thanks, Amanda_x000D_

Hey Carrie,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
How’s it going? Yep, we are definitely interested in featuring the new UV cups and flyers in our 2012 catalog and website for Get Healthy Promos and Stop Smoking Promotions.  I wasn’t too sure if you carried any other UV items besides the cups and flyers but if you do, would you mind sending a list of what they are?_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Lastly, would you kindly be able to give us co-op pricing for 2012 and send us high resolution images of these items? Thanks so much Carrie, we really appreciate your help!! J_x000D_

The Colebecks are great, kind, and classy people. What they did not tell you is that the client had no choice but to use the pens with poor print quality and the orange imprint being off. The client was not happy presenting their new brand in such a poor fashion, but they had no choice. Now the Colebecks are going to pay for this mistake with your discount only because the clients kept the pens, which is standard and customary in the industry. So is it the fair thing to do ? Yes it is. Are your doing the best thing?_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I assume Aakron sent a proof that showed the client copy with no comment on the copy being too small to print?_x000D_
Aakron shipped a sub par order, someone should be looking at these imprints._x000D_
Then and I don’t think you are aware of this until now, you offer a 20% discount and we have to eat the order because it is our policy clients don’t pay for something they did not like. This policy has served our company well and we will continue it. In order to do this we have to work with suppliers of the same mind. This is a great opportunity to make a distributor sales person a fan or position Aakron as just another supplier.  Let me know your position as a company._x000D_

Michelle,_x000D_
Thank you for calling me first thing this morning and discussing the above referenced PO with me.  I think we both should hold off for now on moving forward.  My client is out of town.  Please do not send samples, or produce the product proof samples or any virtuals at this point in time._x000D_
I want to resolve this order and then talk to my client before I ask anyone to do anything that might end up being a waste of time._x000D_
Elliott and I have decided that we are going to pay for the balance of the order after you give us the 20% discount you offered.  I believe after discussing the imprint issue with you, unless my client gave permission to edit the art to not include the last line, we need a pen with a larger imprint area.  I do not think your Merit Grip pen is the pen for this particular art._x000D_
Mike, I hope you have a GREAT vacation._x000D_

Michelle, yes, please call me when convenient for you at 205-870-5714.  Let’s just have a conversation and try to help each other.  I know we all want to be the best we can be and we all want that repeat business!  Michelle, I am very flexible.  Talk to you soon.

Hi Mike,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Below is my contact information. I started about 3 months ago RRD. I'm familiar with your company and already reached out for catalogs etc which I did receive._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I do have a question for you on your overseas capabilities._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
We have a customer that requires special handling. Would you be able to provide the following:_x000D_
*Packing. Items to be placed and sealed in a white plastic remailer. It ships to their warehouse and they distribute that. The remailer is printed black: one side has an item # and the other side has a PO._x000D_
*Delivered price - all inclusive. DDP._x000D_
*Preproduction sample required on the item and the remailer._x000D_
*Product safety documentation required. Specific docs Prop 65 compliant or warning labels on the boxes. Depending on the product, other documentation is needed._x000D_
*Generally they run a test order. Varies but the quantity is about 1000. Once approved the roll out quantity varies but can be 5000 or 10,000 or 20,000. Again, it all depends._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
The price quote would include all - delivered._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Please let me know._x000D_
Thanks._x000D_

I hope you had a wonderful weekend.    On a personal note, I was doing yardwork on Friday evening, when the UPS driver showed up to my home.   When he opened the door to his truck he said “my truck smells fantastic and it is making me hungry.    I love it when you order from Taste of Chicago”.   For my birthday last week, my sister ordered 6 Lou Malanati’s pizzas and they were delivered on Friday.   Friday evening as I am inhaling this pizza because my wife is out of town, I was thinking of our conversation a few hours earlier about Chicago foods._x000D_
_x000D_
Now to business, I wanted to thank you for our conversation on Friday.   It was an excellent conversation and I appreciate you sharing with me the background and vision for RR Donnelly when it comes to promotional products.   I hope that I was able to reciprocate with painting a picture about AAkron and what makes us a valued partner._x000D_

As this partnership develops and pending how the integration proceeds, there may be a change to the account numbers.  If there are any changes, I will let you know._x000D_

*   I was not able to locate a record for your office in St Charles.    I was not clear if your office generates PO’s or just helps with the quoting & sourcing process.   If you would like, I could set up your office in our system to ensure separation and receipt of any marketing materials.   Would you be the main contact for that office or is there another person I should list?_x000D_

I would like to make sure that each office has the right amount of sales materials and samples.  I would rather send it to a specific person to share vs. a general contact like samples or something similar._x000D_

As I explained above, since AAkron is an established vendor, this will make the transition to the promo side easier.   When you did look into our existing profile, there were a few pieces of information that was either missing or needed to be updated.  When you have a moment, please send over the following documents you mentioned and we will have them updated or completed:_x000D_
_x000D_

Okay, I was just kind of thinking how to zoom in on what you may groups you may show to . I have picked a bunch of different items , from some of our best sellers  to some items that will be on Special EQP price for the rest of the year ._x000D_
I am not able to send the Specials brochure as we had a misprint and these have to be reprinted, but this can be found on our Website at the below link ._x000D_
This current specials will only be running until 8-31 , and then the new items will be posted at that time ._x000D_

 Have you heard about or New Full color Digital Direct Imprint on our 20 ounce sports bottles?                 What this means to you :_x000D_
      1)      Lower Price –FCD is only about $ .15 more than a 1 color imprint !_x000D_
      2)      No more waiting for heat transfers –which means a quicker turn time_x000D_
      3)      Made in USA so they are always in stock_x000D_

I was told they managed to get all 8,000 pcs shipped today . I was pretty surprised when they called to tell me this, but it is a pleasant surprise !_x000D_
_x000D_
I know you had mentioned looking at a different pen style because the imprint area was smaller than you liked on this one ._x000D_
Was there a particular pen you were looking at ?_x000D_
The 16520 and 16180 both have a slightly larger imprint area and are in the same ballpark . http://www.aakronline.com/ProductsListing.aspx?m=skwd&kwd=16520_x000D_

Attached are pictures of the little ones and of my gentle giant (the little white is the boss)…and yes I had a baby squirrel but he grew up and went back to the wild…broke my heart. I am just an animal lover period, the squirrel fell out of its nest and I nursed it until it was old enough to go back to the wild. He was a lot of fun to have….still miss him. ?_x000D_

I agree, can make any dog a baby or a beast.   It is sad because Pits, Rotts, Mastiffs get such a bad rap because most are just big babies who would lick you to death._x000D_

That is right Maria, I remember when you mentioned that the little Chihuahua is the boss._x000D_

Hi Michelle,_x000D_
_x000D_
We will go with  both colored pens with white imprint._x000D_
_x000D_
Pit bulls are such beautiful dogs, sad that the owners are the bad ones. I call mine my gentle giant…sweet as can be. My 1yr old nephew plays with her and the dog just lets him do whatever. My nephew stuck his fingers in her mouth and the dog just let him and licked him all over his face. My nephew thought it was the funniest thing…I also have 3 little ones and they bully the pit…lol. Especially my little Chihuahua…LOL. You gotta love them!! ?_x000D_

Hello Maria ~_x000D_
The revised Eproof is attached for you . I am told that the black print  will not show well on the blue so they wanted to be sure you saw both options .  The third line is opposite the clip and will print , just is not able to be shown on the virtual …_x000D_
Pit bulls are another animal that gets a bad wrap, just like the rotties (My first true love )_x000D_
My aunt asked me to go with her when she adopted her last 2 Pitbull’s to make sure they were good with my dog and trainable.  Mind this was my first encounter with a pitbull and I was a bit nervous I admit.  Those dogs were smart as a whip , I was shocked how quickly they picked up commands , and so loveable .  She spoils them rotten though and well the  training kind of fell apart ;o)_x000D_
_x000D_
Please let us know how to proceed when you have a free moment Maria ._x000D_

Thank you,_x000D_
